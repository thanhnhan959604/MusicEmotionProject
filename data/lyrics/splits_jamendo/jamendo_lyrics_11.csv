track_1198189,"We build- reconstruct
Piece together- what- was torn apart

The constants keep us
While constantly changing
We maintain what matters most
With our salty sea of sad
And our raw bloody hearts
We maintain what matters most

We build- reconstruct
Piece together- what- was torn apart

Shifty eyes, shifty minds
Shifting all around us
Swiftly sing a different tune
The opportunity has aroused
The excuse- properly executed
Swiftly, swiftly all around us

We build- reconstruct
Piece together- what- was torn apart

Cycles cycling, rhetoric repeated
Again if not now when and then
Blindness perpetuated
Faith misrepresented
Hope coagulated
Again if not now when and then
And then and then and then…

We build- reconstruct
Piece together- what- was torn apart."
track_1198190,
track_1198191,"Life’s been looking kind of bleak
From under these redwood trees
I wish you were here with me but
You’re not.
The rain makes me feel all alone
Fills the river while I sing this song
No one’s here, just me
I’m all alone, all alone

And I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are.

I can’t quite get a hold of my life
Nothing ever seems just right
I dream of you holding me
So tight.
NO.
Reality isn’t my world
Need I prove this again for you?
How can I make my would open to you
How can I, how how can I?
Cuz I-

I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are.

I can’t hang alone much longer
Reality hiding you
I can’t hang alone much long
Without you with- without you with-
Without you with- without you- cuz I

I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are."

I like you more than my own breath
And that’s good 'cause I’ve been losing it 'cause

It’s hard

Oh it’s hard
Soooo hard

I thought it’d get easier as we aged
But the truth is just the problems change
Guess I’m tougher than I used to be
That’s 'cause I’ve got you on my team

Holding my hand and wiping my tears
Helping me process all my fears
When I think there’s nothing that can even be done
You find the one thing to keep me strong, but

It has no existence in space or time

Two days from life by a windswept sea was all we could ever steal

In that small back room I can hold you once more
The single place I want to be
I can leave my pain outside the door
In here you belong to me

No one knows at first glance

Pieces of you melt away

You wanted a ride,
I gave you my car.
You wanted a light

When You wanted me closer
I moved next door   
I gave what I had
But you wanted more 

Chorus

You know that it’s true
Its all about you

Like You put out the trash
You waste all my love
Like you spend all my cash

You speak when I talk
Like Im not even there

track_1203665,"There’s  A Child In The Corner
========================

she takes the limelight
and puts on a show
but underneath she's hurting
and no body knows

she's making em laugh
so hard that they cry
but if they looked closer
deeper into her eyes

there's a child in the corner
and she's shaking with fear
the demons that haunt her
demand all her tears
there's a child in the corner
with her head in her hands
she wants to be invisible
because she can't understand 

those ripples on water
there's a child in the corner

she's seen so much
watched her hero's fall
she sleeps with the light on
turns her face to the wall

and just like her shadow
it follows through life
and every reappearance
cuts from the bluntest knife

she's making em laugh
so hard that they cry
but if they looked closer
deeper into her eyes

there's a child in the corner
and she's shaking with fear
the demons that haunt her
demand all her tears
there's a child in the corner
with her head in her hands
she wants to be invisible
because she can't understand 

confused by love
she didn't get enough

those ripples on water
there's a child in the corner 
there's a child in the corner"
track_1203669,"They gunna kill me tonight
=====================

I’m like the dog that no one would feed
Scrawny , stinky and strong,
And like the dog I never did good
Always doing stuff wrong

But when they caught me with the mayors wife
I had to run like a greyhound dog
I hid myself way back in bayou land
But they found me trapped in the bog

Im a bad man
from the wrong side of town
I think they gunna put me down
Ill put up a fight
When they string me up tight
I think they gunna kill me tonight

Trussed like a turkey Set for thanksgiving day
They chained me up and locked me away
At least I got the meals Id been prayin for
Shoved to me under the door

The preacher read my rites from his battered book
But I didn’t pay no heed
The mayors wife had come just a short while before
And left me with the jail house key

Im a bad man
from the wrong side of town
They think they gunna put me down
But Ill take flight
Before they string me up tight
They think they gunna kill me tonight

Repeat last chorus"
track_1203671,"What Do You Wanna Do?
=======================

counting down the hours
until I see you again
I wanna take it further
more than just good friends

I wanna be able to tell you
how I'm feeling inside
lay my cards on the table
show I've nothing to hide

what about you ooh ooh
what about you
what about you ooh ooh
what about you
what about you ooh ooh
what do you wanna do

you stand there biting your lip
and playing it cool

be nice to get an apartment
maybe even share a bed
somewhere to settle down at night
sit talking till the fires dead

imagine the lights turned down
and the music playing low
holding on to each other
and we're dancing really slow

this is what I see for us
it's all I really think about 
I wanna say goodnight to you
kiss you as the light goes out

what about you ooh ooh
what about you
what about you ooh ooh
what about you
what about you ooh ooh
what do you wanna do

you stand there biting your lip
and playing it cool"

track_1203672,"The Night Owl
===========

The highways chain of light
The deepening of the sky at night
The end of the working day
Some will rest, some will play

The sand man comes to call
Taking prisoners one and all
He’s just rising from his sleep
Wide awake now the night to keep

CHORUS

Oh he’s night owl
Rubbing sand in peoples eyes,
Oh he’s night owl
Rubbing sand in peoples eyes,
Oh he’s night owl
oooohhh

His work is never done
As he runs around after the Sun
Sleep delivered all by hand
With liberal sprinkles of his sand

The highways chain of light
The sun makes light of the night
The start of the working day
Some will work, some will play

I am the go between summer and the lost forever
I am the go between summer and another’s desire
I do it for your beauty
My secret love you can use me
The sharp end of the truth
I do it for your love and duty.
I am the go between summer and the lost forever.
I do it for your love and the beauty of your form
From one to the other the cherry and its juice
You can’t defy the telling signs of fleeing youth
Doesn’t no one understand that where I come and go for love
The salty waters of my eyes fall to the ground
I see you are a magician your flying to close to the sun I am the rain that falls
I see you are a magician flying close to the sun
I am the rain that falls.
I a a go between summer and the lost forever
I do it for your love and the beauty of your form
The breathless stone of a fresh young peach doesn’t understand
The leaves that fall from the tree into her hands
You broke my heart but nothing is ever a woman’s fault
The love will come and go
And the low will form into a glowing light
Restless night hold your woe you’ll never know the way the rivers flow
And the rain will come and take away the pain
That you feel inside
Don’t fake it
Don’t take the strain.
I am a go between tomorrow and a complication
Two goats on the cricket green
A summer of temptation
In between we cant expect to be happy all the time
My phone is off the line
Love inside these places
Nothing flies in the spaces
I am a go between another time of happiness of his and mine
I am a go between a summer, love temptation, fly the line
I am a go between what yours and mine and yours and mine
I am a go between what yours and mine and yours and mine
I am the go between an arrangement and the plain sailing of a happy life."

track_1211211,"I open my eyes and I see this perfect dawn ahead
I feel so small
And there far away somewhere in the morning fog
Lies the land which I’ve been dreaming of
I cannot keep my tears
The breaking bitterness inside is finding its way out
I see the land, it lies ahead
And I will get there

When will this storm stop crushing me?
When will this wind stop blowing me off my fragile ship?

I open my eyes and I see this perfect dawn ahead
I see the land
I see the fields of green
Blue, red and yellow flowers
And feel their perfect fragrance all around me
I see the land and I see houses
With bright lights inside
Someone waits there for me
I see the land, it lies ahead
And I will get there

When will this storm stop crushing me?
When will this wind stop blowing me off my fragile ship?"

I found new meanings and new ways
I knew I needed to see your face

Your colours changed as well and I couldn’t wait
To tell you, love, how much I cared

You’re leaving now but I know I’ll see you again
I hear your voice in a million sounds I play
And I’ll understand what my angel says
He knows I’m gonna see you again

All the rivers I cross – to see you again
All the bridges I burn – to see you again
All the mistakes that I make – to see you again
All the songs that I sing – to see you again"

I'm not your sun and I will never shine 

He's treating me better - the way you never tried 

It's getting colder and colder it feels like rain in my eyes 
But I'm stronger I'll always find a way out 
It doesn't matter tonight what sort of games you are playing 
My wind will lead me to my Northern Star

To live like I want and with whom I would share

But I’m tired of all the things you are telling me

You try,
To prove to me that you love
But it’s not your part
To uncover my soul
You try,
To show me all your love
But it’s not your part
To uncover my soul

Oh please,
Don’t try to be so perfect
I know all about you and still I don’t care
I know that it’s killing you
Oh no,

Nothing I know will ever be more true
I’m obsessed, crazy-mad for you
I can’t face with world without you

A canopy of stars above
Endless possibilities and people to love
I was lost in the darkness
You were shinning so bright
Falling from the sky
Rejuvenating my life
Ohh oh oh oh
Ohh Oh Oh Oh

I thought I’d always be alone
With my misery, I would atone
Like liquid stars, you poured your love
Melting my heart, building my trust
Now I know only one truth
I will forever love you

on the sweet side of the evening
I will lay my body down
Let the chilly night soothe my skin
and spin my head around

let me soak inside your goodness
may this feeling never end
and it's all because of you
azure blue

when you whisper in the silence
all my troubles float away
the starry night, above us sings
a celestial serenade

your open arms, they beckon me
and pull me to your warmth
to be a part of you, azure blue
azure blue 

though time has passed, the image lasts
my memories will not fade

in ways I can't explain

only for you

A knowing stare
Deep in the water

In my past blind despair
Water water everywhere
I bailed and bailed and still it flowed
It got me wet, but I didn’t know

Then I surrendered myself
And I dove right in
In the soothing pool
So began my swim
I found an answer to my prayers
Deep in the water
Water everywhere

But that was then,

A different year
Another drought

I just wanna be just like a wallaby
I just want to go hop in the sun.
I just wanna be just like a wallaby
I just wanna be having some fun.
Hop, hop, hop, like a wallaby
Hop, hop, hop, out in the sun.
Hop, hop, hop, like a wallaby
Hop, hop, hop, having some fun.

I just wanna go run with the buffalo.
I'll just have to go put on my shoes.
I just wanna go run with the buffalo.
I just wanna go running with you.
Run, run, run, with the buffalo.
Run, run, run, getting my shoes.
Run, run, run, with the buffalo.
Run, run, run, running with you.

I wish that I knew all of the caribou.
I wish that I knew all of their names.
I wish that I knew all of the caribou.
I wish that could play all their games.

It's what I want to see.
Part of the family.
It's what I want to be.
Just like a wallaby."
track_1222847,"On the Playground

On the playground we can run
Everyday, in the sun
On the playground we can run
It’s always so much fun.

On the see-saw up and down
Push our feet, off the ground.
On the see-saw up and down
We’re moving around.

On the swing set here we go
Back and forth, high and low
On the swing set here we go
We’ll go fast and slow.

In the sandbox we can bring
All our toys, everything
In the sandbox we can bring
Almost everything.

All the games that we can play
Every night, every day
All the games that we can play
Outside everyday."

I want to stand up and shout, my head's swimming about
You know I cannot sleep at night.
After searching the world, I think I'm finding the girl
That makes me feel alright.

I tell you right from the start, I think I knew in my heart
She's exactly what I need.
I'm not feeling alone, even sitting at home.
I'll tell you what I mean.

Some people told me that she just might be the one.
I thought right there, no more solitaire.
Two hearts beat better than one.

The last couple of days, my minds been in a haze
My thoughts are out there all the time.
I've got nothing to do, I'm just making my move
I think I want her to be mine.

Here in a letter I could tell her what I mean.
We'll take a dare, maybe move somewhere.
And start a family.

I want to get up and scream, I found the girl of my dreams
I feel a new life has begun.
I've waited some days, and I'm happy to say.
Two hearts beat better than one."

Heard it from a sailor that we’d meet our destiny.
From a land of broken promises we wanted to believe.
Listen for a moment we can hear an angel cry.
Still there’s no use asking why.
Still there’s no use asking why.

I think about things that he said and now I can’t forget.
Causing me to act upon some things I knew I now regret.
Looking for an answer since the time we said goodbye.
Still there’s no use asking why.
Still there’s no use asking why.

Looking for some meaning as things went to the extreme.
A group of sullen men were living out a broken dream
The message they received had turned out to be a lie.
Still there’s no use asking why.
Still there’s no use asking why.

Climbing to the surface only to try to hear the sound
Of one hundred lonely faces lying silent on the ground.
I did not see the letter, but I knew you said goodbye.
Still there’s no use asking why.
Still there’s no use asking why."

I believe our time is up
Unless you prove me wrong
Then this love’s corrupt
You’re never home
That which is my heart
This barren land you’ve chosen not to roam

I tried to give you my company
But I see that’s something you won’t accept
What you see is shaped by your beliefs
I wish I believed in us except

I already know that it’s over
So I’ll try my best not to make believe
I feel alright though I’m not sober
I’m drowning in this misery

God please set me free

I beg of you
As I watch my bitterness flow
Just take my hand
And allow our love to grow
This is the hardest I’ve fallen
Now surrounded by gloom
I’d much rather you be here
To help cure these wounds

I’m lying in this half-dead coma
Waiting for my heart to beat
I feel as though I’ve dug my final home
In the back of love’s retreat

So won’t you set me free?
Please set me free from this
I know what I believe shapes what I see
So please won’t you save me
And release me from this

I alread know that it’s over
So I’ll try my best not to make believe
I feel alright though I’m not sober
Yeah I’m drowning in this misery
So God please free me!

I already know that it’s over
So I’ll try my best not to make believe
I feel like hell and I’m far from sober
Yeah I’m drowning in this misery

So God please free me"
track_1225969,"My heart is a land mine, touch me and you’ll see
I will be you’re idol and I will set you free
Touch me and you’ll find I will steal your mind
All I need is one touch and we’ll become one kind

Come on baby, please me
I’ll steal your breath and watch you bleed
What has happened to me?
I’m feeling deadly
Come on baby and tease me
I’ll be tearing it down with your greed
What has happened to me?
I’m feeling deadly

Hiding in the shadows, you cannot escape
I’ll be in the hollows and I will make my claim
If you surrender, you could save your soul
So you should remember that my touch is stone cold"
track_1225970,"Six hours away, I’ve got so much that I need to say
And for that I pray that I’ll see you again someday
The end came too soon
But when you were in my arms, there was no end to you

Pick up my call, let us fall in love
This mental image of you is all I have left to hold
Pick up my call, let us fall in love
You’re beautiful, and with you I want to unfold

You’re busy now I guess, and now I get no rest
These last months we haven’t spoken
So I’m telling you now, I’m fully open
And without you, I feel I’m broken

Please pick up one call
One call is all I need
Please pick up one call
At least so I can rest in peace

You’re still busy I guess, and still I get no rest
I can’t keep my mind off of you
And now I’m getting too tired to test it
Baby you guessed it
I’m a wreck without you

You’re beautiful
One call is all I need
Please pick up one call
At least so I can rest in peace"
track_1225973,"Come on and attack now
Don’t you go and back down
It’s getting time, time to unwind
I want to see your face
Come on and give me a taste
Leave all your worries behind

I’ll meet you where we met for the first time
Put it there and lay it down
You know what I want and we’ll do it all night

It’s me that you need
And I’ll be right here waiting
Come on and live it up

Close your eyes, taste the bliss
This is something that you’re going to miss
It’s going to be hot, so hold on tight
Close the door and shut off the lights
It doesn’t matter ‘cause you’re out of sight
Oh baby you know I can’t resist

You try to figure out what you’re going to say
But just figure out if you like it this way"

I wanna love you so much it hurts
There are no words
But you don't exist in my world
All I ever wanted
Was to hold you in my heart
For all the world to see
All I ever wanted
Was for the whole world
To sing with me
There's plenty of room in our dimension
For a little more love comprehension
It don't matter
If I'm talking about faith or peace or the human race
Cuz at the end of the day
My heart still breaks"

I feel there’s something you need to know
All these feelings inside cannot hide

Out in the cold
Your cheeks begin to redden
There’s nothing left to find
We’ve found our own piece of heaven

We fall into this scene
Everything seems far from belief
We belong 
Here

We fall into this dream
Every moment a sight unseen
You and I
Love

I could never leave you here alone
I kneel down on my knees for love"
track_1227239,"I got this feeling of freedom
Peeking its way through all this loss and confusion
And I can feel it flowing through me
Like a religion
It's time to make sense of all this losing
I don't know who I'm fooling
But a change is due
It's something elevated
Resonated
Never tasted
Something elevated
Resonated
Not to be wasted
Ask why we don't get what we need
We don't even know what it is we see
I just want to go back to the day
When I thought that I had
Something to say"
