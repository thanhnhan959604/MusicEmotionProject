track_1421788,"Look into my eyes
Let's live on forever
We burned all of our regrets
There is nothing more to remember

When death knocks at our door
We won't answer, we won't go
We'll be running through the trees
We won't look back, now or ever

When we've reached the top of the hill
We'll watch the cities fall and rebuild
We'll live to see the end of the world
We'll know our love will never be killed

Burning down around us
Everything we know laid bare
When the stars fall from heaven
Where will they land?

Listen to my voice
Let's love always together 
We've counted all of the stars
They don't seem that far at all

This is the last night.
As the ashes fall from the sky
The calm settles in
What do we do now?"
