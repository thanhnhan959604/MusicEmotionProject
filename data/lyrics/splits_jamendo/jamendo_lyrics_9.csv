Tell me, tell me,
What’s the matter with you ?

Lying on the ground
You’re smiling
You don’t make a sound, when they try to get a reaction out of you
Nobody understands
What’s the matter with you ?
What’s the matter with you ?

It seems like you’re in a dream
I would love to guess what you see
Is it something beautiful ?
What’s the matter with you ?
What’s the matter with you ?
Tell me, tell me,
What’s the matter with you ?

Can you feel my hand on your face ?
Will you recognize your best friend ?
Now i feel alone, without you

Nobody understands

Song: Makin' A Killin'
Album: Kapital Ambition

Hook
I'm dreamin', that's what I do
Niggas is schemin, semen
I'm getting out my dreams, no chillin'
Villian, for this paper i'm makin a killin'
Got a feeling that soon success is what imma be seeing

Verse 1
Im sinnin' but seems like God keep on forgiving
Fame and fortune is what I want but not selling my soul
Call me King Blanket, what you should do is obey
I love him so much, G.O.D, I guess I'm gay
I don't talk too much, I deal with actions like a mime
I put in time and work for the perfection of this rhyme
I would be in jail already if rappin' was a crime
So imma do this sh*t till the f*ckin end of time
I don't just write bars, I write sick ones
Some ones gonna die unless you take 'em to the doc
Test me you gonna fail, like ufundiswa uChirikure
Nigga listen, I aint toilet so I don't take sh*t
Money on my money, I see nothing but my fam
They say life is a test, are we on a f*ckin exam?
Uyithatha, cathi uMtsabha uzomphatha
KuleRap angiyindawo ungafunga nguLatha

Hook

Dedication is what I show
Know I'm sick with the flow
Guluva my big bro
I couldn't ask for more
Da Edge be the team bringing dope sh*t more
The Kapital City is what I'm representin' for sure
Omrappa abaningi basirephela iNonsense
Dissa mina son ngzokshiya udabuke njengensense
You wanna defeat me, this is your one and only chance
Beating you so easy like pullin' down your girl pants
I spit bullets every bar is so lethal
I aint got a watch so I guess I'm timeless
I want first place, nothing less
i'm obsess with success
Want trouble, come fast
I spit these bars for you to be behind them
Don't brag about swag, aint nobody gives a damn
Warning shot on your eye, take it out and learn the lesson
Friday the 13th, kill niggas like Jason

Hook

Song: To Whom It May Concern
Album: Kapital Ambition

The world stops when I hop on a beat b*tch
All my niggas make a killin' like Big Meech
No homo but I got this sh*t on Smash
Ngshiye bethukile like the Pinetown car-crash
Only 3 niggas I trust, me, myself and I
Niggas eating chicken wings that why you see 'em aint fly
My flow sickness airborn just to make all them rappers sick
What could possibly go wrong mangidle indwangu ewuTick"

Song: Knight In Shinnin' Armor
Album: Kapital Ambtion

Hook
She my knight in shinnin' armor, I'm down with her
Either rainy or sunny angkhathali i wanna see her
Extraordinary feeling i'm feeling is so loving
A minute is like a year without you right here

Verse 1
I'm down with her, I just wanna be with her
Take you away from them sick dudes mentalities
To a place where me and you can kiss, chill and make love
Anywhere you wanna go I take ya
True L.O.V.E what this nigga want you to see
Eradicated the perception that all niggas are the same
My name, let it bring joy to you my boo
Nobody in the world I desire more than you
Stars at daylight is what I see when I look at you
Ncoah so sweet masublusha like Picachu
Imma love you till the sky turns from the color blue
In other words boo my eternal love is for you

Hook

She my knight in shinnin armor
Manginaye ngyanama
Baby my heart is yours not literally speaking
Everybody back off, she's not for the taking
Got a lady not a girl, that's so easy to tell
First thing I wanna see is you when I wake up
Let me be your mirror ekseni when you do your make up
Each day is no day without you on my side
I want em all to see how we match you and me
Always pic-taking, I'm so in love with a model
They say beauty is inside well you overflourishing with it
Anything you wanna do baby its whatever Im with it
Keep that place reserved for this nigga to hit it

Hook

Jesus I hope nothing is gonna break us
Our trust, to be more strong and robust
Prevent, any bitterness like bioplus
Make us forcus all upon us
All i want you baby is to give me love and be loyal
Believe in this nigga like a nigga believe in you
Stay committed to each other therefore we'll never be through
Through them ups and downs, gotta overcome 'em together

Hook

track_1142732,"I'm going underground
to reach the bottom of it all
no effort and ambitions left
alone - I find eternal rest

temptations seem to close
the decency and slavery here 
there's always one in your back
who drags - you upward again

you're running up the stairs
reaching the roof top
the horizon, where the sea blends 
into the sky.

Help me, help me, I can see the light 
(killing me, killing me. I'll follow you down)
Help me, help me, I'm falling down
(killing me, killing me. I'll follow you down)

It's been a long way down
beneath the surface of this world
where laws of men don't matter much 
at all - and money graps no hold

You're sinking down below
the frontiers of a proper life
where no choice is left to be your own
and truth - is set by those who rule

What's worth all the money
what's worth all the pride
we're sentenced to death
we see the light

I'm rising high
for a final fall
I'm one step off
the exit sign"
track_1142735,"like another sense
an inner eye
a new instinct
another look at the night
behind each door
another room

in a single shell 
a whole sea
a deep-drawn sigh
overpeer the Land
behind each hill
another dale

turn over a new leaf
thumbing through a book
void in any mind
its never too late
to do anything
if you really want

the moment
while you close your eyes
the time
'til your heart goes to the beat
the point of time
you dont know how to go on ( and on and on.. )

like a woman's heart 
a deep ocean of secrets
Like an eagle in the sky
free falling, falling down
like the phoenix rising
from the ashes
high and down 
out of the circle
Jumping over the line"

People gonna hate let them do it
shine like it ain’t nothing to it
Damn you a major in-flu- ence 
skate like there ain’t nothing doing
Live life don’t say nothing to them

1st verse

People telling lies on me
Feeling like Pac 
All eyes on me
Whats my next rhyme
Gonna be
Dull mother fuckers can’t never ever
Shine off me?
Wait for it
Wait for it 
Wait for it 
Don’t worry the
My haters is gonna pay for it
chase dreams dumb 
Niggas chase whores
over sea’s
On a great tour
Or maybe I’m just dreaming
It beats being with demons or
A nigga scheming or
At least im thinking of an achievement 
People talk shit for 4 seasons 
For no reason 
people dog lebron until
lebron show up 
when he step on the paint then their
guards go up
scores up 
all the applauds go up 
and everybody in the whole damn court goes nuts

Hook 2x
People gonna hate let them do it
shine like it ain’t nothing to it
Damn you a major in-flu- ence 
skate like there ain’t nothing doing
Live life don’t say nothing to them


2nd verse

spectators 
side liners 
spending days
coming up with sly comments
that’s
psychotic 
why try a tarnish 
such a fly product?
Why be mad just cause I got? Hey!
I may never know 
Wave to the haters
That put me on the pedestal
talk smack
But they really
Know I’m incredible 
Unforgettable young blue eyes
the new guy 
is on schedule 
man behind bars and thats minus the federal 
Stone giant what the hell
Could some pebbles do
While you Revel In drama
Im building revenue 
Tell them you’ll get them tomorrow their ain’t
Nothing stressing you
Life goes on
Lifes goes on
You was the shit even
Before those lights went on
They gonna trash you
Even if they like your song
People always gonna judge homie
right or wrong?

Hook 2x
People gonna hate let them do it
shine like it ain’t nothing to it
Damn you a major in-flu- ence 
skate like there ain’t nothing doing
Live life don’t say nothing to them


Ending
We don’t give a damn what you did
We don’t give a damn who are 
homie you aint down with the team
We don’t give a damn what you think 
We don’t give a damn what you thought"

Feel my thundery whip
when you go against me
I will tame you fast n 
you will never get free

Like a light beam in the darkness
Like a wave on open sea
Like a storm in sibiria
I will come  , you will see

He is known as the De-Virginator
