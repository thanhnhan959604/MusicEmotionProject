track_0003346,"Hey girl
dis moi
tu n'sais plus ou tu vas
tu cours toujours
échappée de ce jeu pour mieux
recommencer

REFRAIN :
Laisse moi te guider
te tourner 
vers d'autres endroits
t'emmener chaque foix
te garder
là tout près de moi

Hey boy
tu es mon obstacle 
un mur de pierre 
pas un miracle
un soupir pour guérir
un souvenir qui hantera ma vie
et mon avenir

REFRAIN (x2)

Le bruit d'un murmure que l'on prononce tout bas
Au fur et a mesure  que le temps avancera
que le temps sera dur
nous serons la pour toi

REFRAIN (x2)"
track_0003347,"Un sentier pour l'infini
fait de légendes et fait d'oubli
un chemin pour une vie
fait de miroir ou d'infini

REFRAIN

je me demande si c'est la nuit
qui m'entraine loin des humains
en reve chose
en reve pose
qui m'emmene comme un matin

Un sentier pour un oubli
fait de lumiere fait de folie
un chemin pour une nuit
fait de regards ou bien d'oubli

REFRAIN

Je me sens fière de cette vie
qui m'entraine loin des humains
en reve d'Oz
en reve rose
qui m'emmene comme un matin

Un sentier pour une vie
fait de traverses et de soucis
un sentier pour l'infini
fait de lumiere ou fait d'oubli

REFRAIN

Un chemin pour un maudit
Fait de hasard ou bien d'envies
Je traverse la nuit
qui m'ammene a ce matin

Comme le soleil est-ce un réveil
je ferme pourtant les yeux ..."
track_0002263,"Deadly people
Give me an other chance

Smiling people
Give me an other dance

Oh deadly people
Give me an other
Smiling people
Give me an other
Oh my grandfather
Don’t be afraid
It’s just an other
An other day

On the other side! X4

Don’t be afraid X4

Deadly people
Give me an other dance"
track_0003348,"Une nuit j'ai essayé de toucher les étoiles
La blanche lune a mes cotés semblait pale
cette nuit j'ai revé d'un ciel bleu bien trop calme
c'était pour nous deux une histoire trop banale

REFRAIN

Les paroles ne sont rien a coté de l'amour 
pour toujours dire sans fin l'importance de ce jour

Cette nuit j'ai rencontré au loin ma bonne étoile
elle m'a dit que quelqu'un avait suivi ma voile
cette nuit j'ai pensé a la pluie a la mort
pour ne plus regarder ton visage ni ton corps
la partie est finie
je suis éliminée
j'ai perdu de toi notre amour passé

REFRAIN

Mon navire a la mer n'attendait que mon coeur
mon corps et mes prières effacant les erreurs
et l'espoir m'a donné une chance de survivre
a tous ces regrets ces passions et ces promesses

REFRAIN"
track_0003349,"Il garde sa chaleur dans son corps
comme de l'or
il part sans vraiment savoir ou aller
la ou ses pieds le trainent
la ou sa tete le mene

REFRAIN

traverse le temps les nuages t'attendent
au bord du rivage une image s'étend
imagine ta vie imagine ta vie

Il rie en silence 
il oublie son passé
il pense a l'amour et a l'insouciance
de son etre
son existence

REFRAIN

Il sent la peur les gestes et la douleur
il decouvre lentement 

REFRAIN (x2)"
track_0003350,"Hey girl
don't cry look at me
ever smile
you can
you do 
you're fifteen
you musn't forget
your life

REFRAIN

You can try you can fly
you can stay you can stay the same girl
you'll find him
you'll love him
but you can't stay you can't stay the same child

Hey boy
you're crying but why
open your heart 
and look the sky
find the girl
who knows you
and knows your eyes 
you are so alone
open your mind

REFRAIN (x2)

Listen the wind 
and follow your way
look at the rainbow
it's a lovely day
a lovely day
there's a lovely day

REFRAIN (x2)"

track_0006719,"I am a keeper
Of promises and lies
And I'm a believer
In things I can't deny

I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost at any cost
As long as I can find my way again

Millions of lights in the midnight sky
Trying to guide me along
Some of them wander, and some lights fade
Others would steer me wrong
Millions of lights in the midnight sky,
None of them bright as you are
I'll set my course by you
My northern star

I am a seeker
who cares not what he finds
And I am a healer
Of any wounds but mine

I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost at any cost
As long as I can find my way again

Millions of lights in the midnight sky
Trying to guide me along
Some of them wander, and some lights fade
Others would steer me wrong
Millions of lights in the midnight sky
But none of them bright as you are
I'll set my course by you
My Northern Star"
track_0006720,"My love what's happened to you
You used to be open and welcoming
Now you're suspicious of everything
My love what's happened to you

Friends say that the best days are behind us
The future is ugly and dark
And there are other people, other places
Where I could be making my mark

Start fresh, start new
Leave behind the potential I still see in you 

But I don't want to leave you America
Don't want to leave you America
Don't want to leave you
I still believe in you 
Don't want to leave you America"
track_0006721,"I used to be a straight talker
Used to be straight as an arrow
Used to be on the straight and narrow
Now I’m all sideways

I can’t see where I’m going
I can’t see where I have been
All I can see is the scenery
That serves to fence me in
Fence me in, fence me in

I used to be a straight talker
Used to be straight as an arrow
Used to be on the straight and narrow
Now I’m all sideways

And you’re looking at me as if I can tell you
Why the stars are aligned
And you’re looking at me as if I have answers
To enlighten your mind
But if there are answers here to find
You brought them with you, baby"
track_0006722,"It's true you're gone baby I saw you leave
You got on the airplane and waved back at me
You taxied the runway and climbed up the sky
And left me at home here with myself and I

But no matter how far away you might be
I can still feel the weight of your body on me
Baby, that’s gravity

Back in the orbit of everyday things
Objects are pulling my celestial strings
Forcing upon me their new point of view
As if I no longer orbit around you

Days pass me by and the phone doesn't ring
You're far away and accelerating
I'd pull you back if I had enough weight
Escape velocity says it's too late

But no matter how far away you might be
I can still feel the weight of your body on me
Baby, that’s gravity"
track_0006723,"Oh no, I'm late for work again, 
Sky is the color of concrete
Wouldn't you know it would have to be raining

Oh no, the streets are full of strangers 
Clutching their soggy umbrellas
And none of them offer to share their protection

Gotta be this town, dragging me down
Wish that I could be

In California
The trees are always green in California
The streets are always clean in California
And the people look so happy
Cuz they wake up every day
In California
 
Oh no, you've got that face again
The one that says I failed you
And as usual I'm clueless about it

Oh no, I do not have the strength 
To field your foolish questions
Sometimes I wonder why we're still together

Gotta be this town, dragging me down
Wish that I could be

In California
The trees are always green in California
The streets are always clean in California
And the people look so happy
Cuz they wake up every day
In California

The sky is always blue in California
We could start brand new in California
Where everyone is happy
Maybe we’d be happy too
In California

Baby I'm not imagining things
With my own eyes I've seen it on the screen 
And if the camera lies
I want it to lie about me"
track_0006724,"On a hill in the middle of town
Sits a little white church
With a little white steeple
But none of the people
Go there anymore

And the bell still rings on Sunday
And the deacon he still prays
And if you listen carefully
You can still hear the choir sing Amazing Grace

On a hill in the middle of town
Sits a little white church
With a little white steeple
But none of the people
Go there anymore

Preacher you can't save me
Put your bible on the shelf
Preacher you can't save me
Cuz I've already saved myself

On a hill in the middle of town
Sits a little white church
With a little white steeple
But none of the people
Go there anymore"
track_0006725,"I was at the speakeasy with a tonic and gin
Trying hard to get lucky when Cecilia walked in

The dim light concealed her as a slim silhouette
But what it revealed I would never forget

I gathered my courage, I straightened my frame
I searched for a line and I spoke as it came

Your face is familiar, your face is familiar
Your face is familiar but I don't remember your name.

We talked in the corner, we talked on the dance floor
We talked until closing, talked out the front door 

I said ""If I say that I love you, could it be an excuse
To take you to bed?"" She said, ""Then I love you, too.""

I was at the speakeasy with a tonic and gin
Trying hard to forget her when Cecilia walked in

She smiled at me shyly like the first time we met
And I told her the things I'd been trying to forget

I said, ""Now that you're here love, it's hard to believe
What was it possessed me when I let you leave.

This is so unexpected it doesn't seem real
But if speaking is easy, love, speak what you feel.""

She looked at me softly, her eyes were like flames
She searched for her feelings and spoke as they came

Your face is familiar, your face is familiar
Your face is familiar but I don't remember your name.

I was at the speakeasy with a tonic and gin…"
track_0006726,"Twenty miles behind him
200 miles before
He’s back in LA County 
And he’s knocking on her door

If he gave her warning
He wonders what she’d do
Throw her arms around his neck
Or beat him black and blue

And he says
Lyle won’t you sing her a love song
She believes in what you say
Tell her if she wants me
I’m already on my way

Lyle won’t you sing her a love song
Make it tender, make it funny
Lyle won’t you sing her a love song
With your voice as sweet as honey

Twenty years behind her
And just two hours before
She’s on her way to anywhere
That opens up a door

Her bags are in the backseat
And her coat is on the stair
And her mind is on the man coming back
To find she won't be there

And she says
Lyle won’t you sing him a love song
He believes in what you say
Tell him that I’m sorry 
I’m the one that got away

Lyle won’t you sing him a love song
Make it tender, make it funny
Lyle won’t you sing him a love song
With your voice as sweet as honey

Two-hundred miles behind him
Twenty miles before
He’s back in LA County and he’s knocking on her door"
track_0006727,Instrumental
track_0006728,"You have a hole in your heart
Makes it easier to wear around your neck
And when you sway it swings between
What you lost before and  haven't quite found yet

Heart on a string and love on the line
You've had a lot of takers
Do you want someone who'll give this time

You believe that love is just around the corner
You believe in waiting until your dreams come true 
You need to know that there is nothing love can do
Til you believe in you 

You have a smile for every face
And a different face for everyone you meet
Well it cheers up my day, but I've got to wonder
When was the last time you smiled yourself to sleep"
track_0006729,"When I was with you
I was a millionaire
The life of the party, handsome and debonair
When I would leave, without fail
Eyes of the women would cling to my coattails

When I was with you
I was a movie star
Cameras would flash when I sprang from my car
My accent was nearly authentic
Every gesture was tres photogenic

But the sun's up too long
And the bed is all wrong
There's sheet where your feet were
And space where your face was
I've forgotten what my place was
But I knew, I'm sure I knew

When I was with you
I was a confidante
The keeper of secrets for dandies and debutantes
They'd whisper to me their cherished infraction
End with a flourish and gauge my reaction

When I was with you
I was a clever thing
Words came together like pearls on a string
Everyone cheered in amazement
When they would catch what my turn of a phrase meant

But the sun's up too long
And the bed is all wrong
There's sheet where your feet were
And space where your face was
I've forgotten what my place was
But I knew, I'm sure I knew

When I was with you"
track_0006730,"Isn't it funny
The way things finally go
I found my religion
On a beach in Mexico

And the tide was rising
And the sun was sinking slow
And the eyes of a woman
Told me all I need to know

And If I were a man of faith
I'd fall down on my knees
And thank her for the miracle
That she has been to me

And if I were a man of faith
I would write hymns about her
And the day that I found grace
In her most holy place

I have no opinion
On life beyond the grave
But right here in this live
I know that I've been saved

Baptism by fire
Yeah, I've been born again
I'm hers and hers only
Forever and amen."
track_0006731,"We could take the freeway
It would be quick and easy
Home free before you know it
We could take the freeway

We could take the freeway
Every exit looks the same
They all have a number instead of a name
We could take the freeway

Let the others pass us by 
We'll get where we're going in plenty of time
Keep a hand on the wheel and one on my thigh
And take the slow road

I know a road
A slow road, a stop and go road
It's a twist to and fro road
I know a road

I know a road
The streetlights are few and far
Some of them flicker like halogen stars
I know a road

Let the others pass us by
We'll get where we're going in plenty of time
Keep a hand on the wheel and one on my thigh
And take the slow road"
track_0006732,"And piano is my forte
And quiet is my loud
And silence is my anger
And solitude my crowd

And piano is my forte
And falling my safety net
And fortune is my greatest fear
And you are my one regret"
track_0007358,"Danger Girl

I was bored I was curious
Down on love not ready to be serious
Told me that she was feeling the same
Ready for a ride, she was ready for a game

Met me at the door and she looked me over
Said “If you want to be my lover,
There are a few things you should know
Then you can stay or go

I'm a wounded bird and that's no lie
And there's no telling when I'll fly
If you're still in my arms in the morning 
Guess I've given you fair warning.""

She took my hand and led me in
Her touch electrified my skin
And when we danced and when we kissed
I could not resist

Who knew I could feel so safe
In the arms of Danger Girl
Who knew I could feel so real
In the arms of Danger Girl

I was stunned I was paralyzed
When I woke and I realized
As unlikely as it seems
I had just spent the night with the girl of my dreams

Reached my hand out for her face
Landed on cool pillow case
And then I knew that before the dawn
Dangergirl had gone

Can't believe she's gone (x3)

Then I heard a sound from the doorway
She said OK, we'll try it your way
And when we danced and when we kissed
She could not resist

Thank god that I met you
If you fall I will catch you
Never gonna forget you
Dangergirl"
track_0007359,"Move a little closer to me
Move a little closer
Skin on skin
Come on in
My arms are open

I know what you're thinking
Can I trust him I don't know him
But you know me better
Than time would suggest
 
My darling you knew me 
From the moment, the very moment
Your head first rested 
on my chest

I know you've been wounded
By your best friend and by strangers  
And you think it's dangerous
Falling so soon
 
There ain't no place safer
In this cold world in this whole world
Than right here beside me
in your room"
track_0007360,"Used to be renowned, used to play the town
Used to let any kind of friend around
Used to recreate, used to come home late
Used to yell if you stayed up to wait
I know I hurt you

Used to improvise, used to rationalize
Used to face your face and tell you lies
Used to run a scam, used to be a sham
Used to make you cry, didn’t give a damn
I know I hurt you

But if you give me one more chance
I’ll show you all the love 
That I’ve come to understand
If you give me one more chance
I’ll show you I can be 
A better man

Used to run in fear, used to disappear
Used to let my ego interfere
Used to be risque, used to join the fray
Used to accuse you of naivete
I know I hurt you"
track_0007361,"Taking you for granted baby
Was my mistake number one
Number two was walking out on you
Before the conversation was done

And now I got two strikes against me
But it won’t get me down
Mistake number three, it ain’t gonna happen to me
cause I’m turning things around 

I’ve come full circle 
In my philosophies
I’ve turned myself around 360 degrees
I’m a new man, baby
And I’m down on my knees
I’ve turned myself around 360 degrees

We won’t get any younger baby
There ain’t no fountain of youth
You could do worse than stick with me girl
You know I’m telling the truth

I know I had it coming to me
On that much we can agree
I was wrong you were right and the fight has taken its toll
On the man I used to be"
track_0007362,"I’m just a man, a simple man
Why do you seek your truth from me
I’m just a man, a simple man
The truth has yet to set me free

I worry what the future holds
I do not want to die alone
I worry what the future holds
I have no power but my own

Forgive me for what I’m about to do
Forgive me for what I’m about to do

I carry all that I can bear
No cross was ever made for two
I carry all that I can bear
And bury all my care in you

These nails alone are not enough
To hide the pain already mine
These nails alone are not enough
To turn the flesh into divine"
track_0007363,"Have I been here before
The landscape’s peculiar
Have I been here before
Nothing’s familiar

There must be a way out
It’s a tricky endeavor
There must be a way out
Do I wander forever

I get lost in my head when I think of you
When I think of you I get lost in my head
I get lost in my head when I think of you
When I think of you I get lost in my head

Could have followed the trail
To get home before night comes
Could have followed the trail
But the birds ate the bread crumbs

Tried to turn you away
But the shadows remind me
Tried to turn you away
Have you come back to find me"
track_0007364,"I'm alone in a room
In a room
In a very small room

And the air wraps around me
Like a shroud
On a corpse in a tomb

Shoulda brought you with me
Like a torch in the gloom"

Seule, sous la pluie de glace, elle court, en sanglots, trébuche, (et) repart
Transie dans sa fine robe détrempée, elle fuit en vain, voudrait se tuer

	Une bougie folle oublie
	Un ange une transe
	Mélange étrange
	H-3, T-O-C, 
	Quelques heures,
	Petite fleur bleue
	Tu surgis des cendres

Elle implore le gris, supplie le vent, en vain négocie son destin
Devra t-elle prier encore ? Chaque minute invoquer ?
Elle ira jusqu'au bout de la lande décharnée s'offrir contre sa vérité"

It strengthens your heart and gets rid of the dark and it eases away the strain.

Out in the air there's a skip full of shoes of the people who've roamed all their lives.
A written off car of a couple of guys who are coming back home to their wives.

I find that I stop thinking about you
when I'm out in the air.
But I'm reminded that my life's empty without you and I'm walking straight back home.
And I'm walking straight back home.

(Instrumental)

I find that I stop thinking about you
when I'm out in the air.
But I'm reminded that my life's empty without you and I'm walking straight back home.
And I'm walking straight back home.

Now I want to take a walk out in the air; I want to feel the bright sun on my skin.
I want to do what the other people have done and be where my friends have all been.

I find that I stop thinking about you
when I'm out in the air.
But I'm reminded that my life's empty without you and I'm walking straight back home.
And I'm walking straight back home.

Living with the perfect girl.
We all know that only love is free.

But the problem that you have with living in dream worlds
is that they do not survive for very long.
We don't care, 'cause while it lasts it's better than our world.
Now everybody lift your voices, join the song.

Everybody sing. Everybody sing to me.
Everybody sing. Everybody sing.

Living in my dreamworld.
No more pain is gonna come to me.
Living with the perfect girl.

You can improvise
Here are the keys
And if you're tired to improvise
Then trust in the bass
Then trust in the drums

You see you're not alone
They are here with you
You play your music together
Each one is important, each one brings his ingredients
And that's what is good

My future, my future is not sure

And here I lie down on the ground
Concentrated on this psychedelic sound
I let the forms appear in my mind
The pictures stand up in my head
I let them swing and dance and pass by

Oh what a bad day today
My future is up in the air
I really need a change of air
Oh what a bad day today
And still not action in my life
But always in my nights

REF:
I should never have woken up this morning
I felt so good in my dreams
All night long stuck together
Oh what a story to remember

I should never have woken up this morning
I felt so good in my dreams
All night long stuck together
I really need a change of air

Oh what a bad day, but what a night
I hold on not to see the daylight
But the reality 
Slowly catches up on me
All that I ask is to journey on
Please let the dream go on
So find the rythm and come on
Rejoin me to make the dream go on

Ouuh
So find the rythm and come on
Rejoin me to let the dream go on

For you, I want to destroy for you

Tonight, there's only an inch between pain and delight
And I'm full of Canadian whiskey and spite again
Destruction and creation are the same thing after all
The mighty always fall

    And me, I have got no say in my own destiny
    The way it's going, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no

It didn't go the way I planned, we had it in our hands
And everyone had followed our demands
But then you shot that plainclothes cop, I heard a pop and watched him drop
Now we both have blood upon our hands

    And you, well, you made it sound so simple and it was
    And now, I am a fugitive and you're the only cause
    The way it's going, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no

Oh shit, I think I heard a sound from over by the door
I see their shadows looming on the floor
An inch, a mile, it's all the same, now that I am in this game
A shout is heard and time is running out

    And you, in the chaos of the moment grab your gun
    And you, you aim the barrel at that two ton oil drum

I thought that I left them here in this drawer
I guess I'll sit and think about
The last time that I took them out
And maybe I will remember where they are

There, drawer

Where, more

Your patient heart was finally through

But I never cried
I never cried

    Gravity pulls it to earth
    Everyone to a season
    Everything falls into place

        And you were the vagabond at the end of the road
        You were never really gone, but you were never really home

    You spread your arms on the edge of the jagged cliff
    I could feel my arms get stiff
    As I clenched your shoulder

    Stained skin and scars, and the glow of the Norther star
    Above the clamor of the speeding cars
    In the valley below

        And you were the vagabond at the end of the road
        You were never really gone, but you were never really home
        And you were the vagabond, lost on the way
        You were never really gone, but you were never here to stay

    Break of the day, you were standing there
    With your vacant stare
    Fixed on the view

        And you were the vagabond at the end of the road
        You were never really gone, but you were never really home

    Till the other birds are gone
    Wade in the springs
    To bleach those dirty wings
    The raven and the swan

Spreading out along the edges, and breaking up on the shore

The witches dancing with the demons in the night
Their evil minions watch the town as it's in bed

Old Rev. Parris knew that something was amiss
He felt the evil from a spiritual abyss
He knew the time had come to purify the town
Hunt 'em down, hunt 'em down, hunt 'em down


No time was wasted in assembling a squad
This pitchfork army on a mission sent from God
No witch was safe from Rev. Parris' brigade
Their crusade, their crusade, their crusade

""Call the magistrate and don't you wait another minute cuz this
Town is going to hell we don't put away the sinnin' and..
We got no time to let a jury have their turn
Let 'em burn, let 'em burn, let 'em burn""


The damned were crammed into a carriage in the square
Their faces battered and their bodies all were bare
The Reverend brought 'em to an isolated hill
Time to kill, time to kill, time to kill

One by one their necks were snapped beneath the cedar tree
The spirits vanished and the demons all were freed
They dug a hole to hold their devilish remains
They were slain, they were slain, they were slain

    The town was safe from all these wicked dissidents
    They could continue with their life of innocence
    Dispensing justice from a higher power..

They built a church atop the spirits and the bones
Their moans were heard as they were laying down the stones
The witches got revenge beneath that steeple bell
They cast a spell, sent the Reverend to hell"

One day I saw you and pulled up a stool
I said, ""Kathy, I've known you since first grade in school on the bus""
You always had talked about seeing the world
I never imagined you'd still be the girl down the street

I asked, ""why are you still here?"", you just looked confused
You told me ""you can't get from here to Peru in a car,
In Panama you'll hit the Darién Gap
There's suddenly nothing but white on the map and you're done...

    We are one, but light years apart
    We are one, but not quite connected
    We are one...""

And whispers from the neighbors intertwine
The distant glow of beacon lights are

    Wait for it, it's all she ever knew

She opens up her weary eyes
The foggy cloud of vision fills the air
She strains to make some sense of all the
Abstract shapes and colors everywhere

Is shining through the shaking of the artificial moon
The light of noon

Cut ragged glass
Kalidoscope of soapy film refract the rays that pass
The blades of grass

Recite the words that you were taught

The face of man
You stare into the center as the colors bleed away
The dryest rain

You feel the same
The dirt beneath your saddle boots is snaping as you step
Into the scene

This life is just a pale frame

Don't you ever worry bout those dizzy spells you feel
That's just the taming of the ghosts
They can't hurt you, they'll desert you now

Take up your arms
The final day is here, you feel the pinging in your ear

The rally of a lost July, the night preceds the lullabye
And takes away the last supply of day"

No one knows why Jenna Rose just disappeared
But Honcho Graham from Birmingham is here

Train smoke flies and alibis are sinking in the wind
The little toys from little boys are gone
Silence fills the flour mills and streets are clear
Honcho Graham from Birmingham is here

Now every year there's less of here as nature chews it down
A town bereft and all that's left is rust

    I didn't even say a thing
    Everything just disappeared

        I was there the day the river went dry
        and I just watched it flow away
        I just stood and watched that river die
        Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
        You just hope for rain

    You saw the dried-out river bed
    You broke the silence and you said
    Where did all that water go?

    I didn't know, so I replied
    It's just the nature of the tide
    But you knew better

        I was there the day the river went dry
        and I just watched it flow away
        I just stood and watched that river die
        Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
        You just hope for rain

    I took you home, you said good night
    I watched you fade into the light
    Then you vanished through the door

    My skin is dry as desert air
    There's water, water everywhere
    But I'm not thirsty

        I was there the day the river went dry
        and I just watched you flow away
        I just stood and watched that river die
        Cuz when all is gone and nothing else remains
        You just hope for rain

    And just hope for rain
    And just hope for rain
    And just hope for rain"

track_0080376,"Encore un jour où toi, moi, nous
On ne fait qu'un, oubliant tout

Encore une fois, bras dans les bras
Sans penser au monde et ses lois

Pas d'amour bref ou juste sincère
Mais l'amour qui déchire la chair

Sans rendre à chacun une part
Cet amour donné jamais ne part


Encore, sans faire d'effort
On s'aime a tort, jusqu'à la mort
On s'aime si fort

Je sais qu'on devrait par raison
Qu'on devrait s'aimer sans passion


J'entend encore, que de nos corps
On ne devrait pas s'aimer trop fort

S'aimer assez pour vivre heureux
Mais pas pour mourir tous les deux

Mais pour nous c'est déjà trop tard
On pourrait mourir dès ce soir

Pourtant on avez tout rêver
Cet amour nous semblait sans danger


Encore, sans faire d'effort
On s'aime à tort, jusqu'à la mort
On s'aime trop fort

Je sais qu'on devrait tout changer
Qu'on devrait beaucoup moins s'aimer


Moins s'aimer (s'aimer trop fort)
Ne plus en parler (s'aimer encore)
Et tout changer (jusqu'à la mort)
Ne plus penser (soufrir nos corps)"

J'aurai pas trouvé mieux qu'elle
Quelle chance....

...En fait c'est elle que je cherchais
Qui réside dans ma tête, pourtant
Hier j'ai tout fait autrement
Juste l'histoire d'un moment


Ce soir
On rit on chante
Savoir
Sans tout comprendre
Sentir
Qu'on s'aime un peu
Et Partir
Juste tous les deux


Un pas sur l'autre
On danse si droit
On met les autres
Dans l'embaras

Pourquoi eux ils
Dansent sans parler
Ils préfèrent bien mieux
Nous envier


Ce soir
On rit on chante
On repart
Dans notre enfance
Danser
Jusqu'à minuit
Rêver
La fin de la nuit


Enfin ce soir je danse
J'aurai pas trouvé mieux qu'elle
Quelle chance.....

En fait...
J'ai pas osé lui dire ""je t'aime""
Elle n'a pas pris la peine"

Paroles : Jean-François Pollet, Elsa Fenoy

Musique : Fabrice Fenoy

 

Je me sens par intervalle

D'instinct paradoxal

Te griffer ou te bercer

Déloyale ou allongée

 

Je suis pas débile mentale

Pas plus que toi génial

Ces cornflakes dans mon yaourt

Murmurent des doutes

Vais-je me résoudre

 

À vivre sur une planète petite

La cerise confite dans le bonjour matinal

Faudra-t-il

Planète petite

 

J'ai des rêves d'héroïne

Ma vie est orpheline

Adieu l'Afrique, l'Himalaya

Me promets-tu le nirvana 

 

Je t'ai pris dans l'éventail

De mes brumes et grisailles

T'abandonner ou te garder

Suis étonnée, troublée

 

Suis-je à vivre sur une planète petite

La cerise confite dans le bonjour matinal

Faudra-t-il

Planète petite

 

Même si je ne suis qu'une apparence,

Même si mes songes se paient quelques errances

Je suis quand même ta p'tite Mélusine

Une médecine, qui jamais ne te quitte

Sur notre planète petite."

J'aime quand tu bois, que tu vois,

Dans ton valpolicella

Tes remords et mes efforts

Puisque que tu me questionnes

 

J'aime tes retards, tes espoirs

Qui t'emportent loin de moi

Tes appels quand tu perds le nord

Puisque que tu me questionnes

 

J'aime les fantômes qui te hantent

Tes problèmes de finances

Tes malheurs d'enfance

Tes gueulantes

Tes bacantes


J'aime tes états d'âme

Tes retours de flamme

Entre tes dettes

Et tes canettes


Je t'aime, même quand tu doutes

Est-ce bien   ta route

Se suivre mes pas,

De rester avec moi ?

 

J't'aime, te tolère, douce-amère,

C'était juste un inventaire

Un dessin sur la frontière

Puisque que je me questionne"

kiedy słońce wstaje wreszcie
widzę znów jak Bóg rozkłada swoje ręce
gdy wychodzę mu naprzeciw
patrzę w góry jak do nieba się wdrapują

zimny wiatr rozchyla trawy
jakby szukał razem ze mną dnia
to nieprawda, że świat najpiękniejszy
jest gdy się ogląda go w swych snach

boję się otworzyć oczy
gdy przestaję pod stopami czuć kamienie
choć herbata wciąż paruje,
a gdzieś w lesie śpiewa jesień

czuję jakby czas zatrzymał się na zawsze
jakby przestał istnieć cały świat
szybko więc zawracam przesycona
do swojego domu, do swych krat"

Voilà c'est fini 
Il pleure dans mon cœur sans parapluie
Ca y'est George est parti 
Sa Guitare ne pleurera plus sans lui
Un scarabée au paradis 

Couplet 1 

Il etait celui des quatre qui m'a donné envie
D'écrire, de chanter, des mélodies
Il était celui qui a illuminé ma vie
Pour moi, plus qu'un ami

Couplet 2 

Sa musique était pleine de finesses et d'harmonie
De douceur et de mélancolie 
Son image est resté si longtemps au d'sus d'mon lit
Avec trois autres génies

you will know it's possible,

of shifting your awareness into the non physical realms. 
It will soon become a natural ability, 
skill that will allow you to experience anything that your heart desires.

And I knew I’d soon have to decide
Tired of living, just to pay off my bills
So I packed up without a goodbye

I found me a place to stay out from the cold
Where the air and the fishing was free
And my crazy ways I did not have to hide
On the banks of the black swanee

Only wanted a place of my own
Some land and a garden to grow
But in the end I could not dance alone
So I packed up and headed back home

I traded the quiet for the roar of the crowds
The dawn for the big city lights
Got me a job at a bank here downtown
And I drank away my lonely nights

How I dreamt of that place of my own
Where I could remain as I am
And I dreaded the way that I headed back home
When the solitude I couldn’t stand

Then fate found a girl with the moon in her eyes
And a beauty of likes never seen
But her heart was a treasure to never be mine
And she left me in sheer misery

Take me back to that place of my own
Where no one can hear a man cry
I don’t care if I must die alone
I know now to not comprimise
I know now to not comprimise"
track_0134739,"Feelings are strange, especially when they come true
I had a feeling ’bout this long ago
What we had, what we’d said and done
It wouldn’t do

I had a dream, it could last the rest of time
And we could somehow change the world
From vivid black and white

But the sun won’t rise tomorrow, because we can’t control tonight
Don’t worry about the sorrow of the folks we’ll leave behind
I wish there was a way that you could make me change my mind
But they’re coming here tomorrow, so tonight we’ll say goodbye…

I must admit, I sure will miss the rain
Cooling off these hot Guiana nights
And doing what they can to help
Wash away the pain

I can’t explain, what became of paradise
They’ve had us running for some years
And we put up quite a fight

But I won’t return to hell because I’ve seen the other side
They can try to stop the flaming but they can’t put out the light
I wish there was a way we didn’t have to say goodbye
But they’re coming here tomorrow, so tonight we’ve got to die…"
track_0134754,"One time I was just like ya’ll, I drove a fancy car
With the luck that ran through my life I was gonna be a star
I always had a good friend to see, no matter where I’d go
At the bars and the dancing halls and at the picture shows

But through the fickle friends, the break-ups and the brawls
I’ve always had a song that I could sing
Through the thick and thin I’ve had this old guitar
And I’d wash my worries right down the drain

When my turn for a party came, I knew just what to do
And when it come to illegal drugs, I guess I’ve tried a few
I recall how I loved to drink, and I’d refuse to ride
When my head went through the steering wheel I nearly lost my mind

I was on the brink, they say I almost died
I could hear the angels calling me away
But heaven’s fine for me, some cloud up in the sky
Just make sure I have a harp that I can play

Took a while till I came around, found my friends were gone
The bank came and they took my car, and I was all alone
Took a while till I learned to speak, to talk naturally
Please forgive me if I’m slow sometimes, you know it’s hard for me

I turned to the only friend I had, this old guitar of mine
The one thats seen me through my better years and the worst of times
But the songs that I used to sing, don’t come so easily
All I had that was worth a shit it seems he took from me

With all you take from me, don’t take away my song
It’s the only thought I had for me to stay
If you give me anything, please give me one more song
Without it I don’t want to live another day

Did you ever get the feeling that you wanted to go?
Still had the feeling you needed to stay?
The man in the mirror is a vision of what you’ve become
Because he ain’t got a feeling or a reason to stay
And all of his thoughts are promises of yesterday
Did you ever get the feeling like you wanted to go?"

Who’s gonna take my ma when I’m in prison?
She ain’t getting younger now and I’m her only child.
How can I be her son when I’m in prison?
And who’ll be there to put her in the ground?

How I wish I could return and change that place and time
Things were slow at the factory and they said to take the night
But when I made it home, my girl was not alone
And in my rage I gunned that women down.

Who’s gonna take my dog when I’m in prison?
Take him out and run him ’round when come hunting time?
How can he survive if I’m in prison?
All his life he’s always by my side.

How I wish I could return and change that place in time
I’d beat her up and I’d throw her out and there I’d draw the line
But I’ve always had a flaw of a heart I can’t control
And in my rage I gunned that woman down.

Who’s gonna take my girls when I’m in prison?
Scare away there boyfriends and teach them how to drive?
How can I be there pa when I’m in prison?
Who’ll be there to give away the bride?

How I wish I could return and change that place and time
I’d take the kids and I’d go to town and I’d cool down for a while
But when I saw her in the throws I felt my world explode
And in my rage I gunned that woman down."

If we close our eyes, and pray for life

To live it out in peace

And the hay’s still in the fields, and I don’t believe
Look how tall the grass has grown, I won’t believe
There’s no one round to carry on, you promised me you’d grow old with me

So while you’re still around to hold
Let me take you home, feed you full
Keep those pounds from dropping
It gets so sterile there and cold
In your cancer ward
Where people go and don’t return
As they were before

And the hay’s still in the fields, and I don’t believe
Look how tall the grass has grown, I won’t believe
No I can’t believe you’ll soon be gone, you promised me you’d grow old with me"

…it’s my wedding day

So long, since we were lovers
And you shared my bed
So sad, we had to let go
Of the dreams we’d shared

I didn’t call to hear I love you
I just hoped you say
You’re glad, and so proud of me
…it’s my wedding day
…it’s my wedding day

So so long to what we thought of
I finally found my prayer
So much of what we fought for
Seems like yesterday

I didn’t call to say I love you
I just called to say
I finally found the one I’ve looked for

En s'écroulant sous le poids des châtiments
Quand on verse la larme dernier émerveillement
Quand on se noie pour un soubresaut de lumière

Quand on s’éprend de l'équilibre et de ses penchants
Quand le vertige a fini d'assaillir le dernier résistant
Quand tomber c'est aussi s'évanouir
Quand l'effort est inscrit aux bornés absents

Quand dans la force on oublie la genèse
Quand dans le délicat ne se fait plus les rois
Quand on paye la seconde pour se sentir plus a l'aise
Quand on taquine de trop près la suprême glaise

Quand on s'fait peur que limite on s'assassine
Quand on crache rieur en 2,3 coups d'héroïne
Quand on oublie de taire le trop plein de protéines
Quand la sagesse n'est pas une saine vitamine

Quand on sait, quand on songe que l'on sent tout ce sang
Quand on sent qu'on oppresse qu'on éclate
Quand on perd son rêve en attendant sa date
Quand on en nie ce qu'on sent, qu’on n’est pas serein

Quand on se chauffe la tête à se la faire bouillir
Quand tout s'emmêle quand tout s'échappe
Quand s'évapore la seule touche qui fait souffrir
Quand arrive le pas, le seul qui attise

Quand entrevoir l'avenir c'est déjouer ses plans
Quand les comètes, à nouveau, s'écartent de nos vivants
Quand soudain le mal n'est plus tragique
Quand soudain la force rejoue sa dernière mi-temps

Quand être sage c'est aussi l'ouvrir
Quand l'ouvrir trop c'est gâcher l'adage
Quand vouloir s'est juste courir
Quand penser, c'est construire un héritage"

I watched you fly away
Across the empty sky
I turned around and waved goodbye

And now it's me alone
It's just an empty home
That's on an empty street
In a town that always sleeps

    And a blind man in the darkness knows no difference
    But I have grown accustomed to the colors that you bring

I check the dial tone
On the telephone
But when I try to speak
The reception gets so weak

I took an hour's drive
Into the countryside
The sky was bright and clear
But it was cold without you here

    And my mind is turning back before I knew you
    And the numbness was the only thing I'd ever really known
    And I was home

        Long ago, I was happy by myself
        Long ago, it was me and no one else
        Long ago, and then I saw your face

I got a photograph
Beneath a sheet of glass
Inside a cherry frame
But it is never quite the same

It's just a memory
A spot in history
But that's no good to me
When I am living here and now

    Oh, I've tried to make my peace with all the silence
    I have tried to patch the cracks, I've got my finger in the dam

    And I've tried to find contentment in seclusion
    But I will never really smile till the day that you return
    Till you return"
track_0162027,"I went down to the parade
The streets were closed and everybody huddled to the barriers
Hoping for a better view, waiting for the floats to come through
And leave a trail of confetti in their wake

   Oh, on a thousand roads
   We are coming home

Yellow streamers on the ground
And blue balloons are floating overhead like restless satellites
Focused on the concrete, and straying down the side streets
At the mercy of the temperamental breeze

   Oh, on a thousand roads
   We are coming home
   Old familiar roads
   We are coming home

Every face was to the sky
A small town on a summer day to waste away with no better plan
Than to sit and watch a stray balloon, if only for an afternoon
And then continue on their way, another day

   Oh, on a thousand roads
   We are coming home
   Old familiar roads
   We are coming home"
track_0162030,"I've been sleeping with the lights on, buried in regrets
Breaking into sweats, naked as a falling leaf

It's a natural reaction, driven to distraction, 
Clawing at the ghosts I'll never meet

Oh, I don't know, where they go
When they vanish in the corner of my eye
And I, don't know why, I don't know
If they stay below or rise up to the sky

    But I'm letting go
    I'm letting go
    It's a history that never really grows
    I'm letting go
    I'm letting go
    It's a silent wind that never really blows
    I'm letting go

I'm a slave without a master, heading for disaster
Kicking up the dust in the middle of the road

I've been waiting on a free ride ticket
To a seaside thicket on the edge of Puget Sound

And there I'll sit, and I'll admit
That I was only just a guest inside my skin
And by the dawn, I'll be gone
And I won't be holding on to anything again

    [Chorus]"
track_0162034,"History repeats itself
In the patterns in the stone
We close our eyes, and fumbling,
We listen, or we don't

The anchorman is babbling
The weatherman's a liar
The sports report's a waste of time
For the bored and the tired

    And the past is all we talk about
    Cuz it's all we've ever known

    I won't go back to the simple life
    In the comfort of the womb
    I'm finding a new road home

If I'm late for my own funeral
Don't let me hold you up
Just tell them I've got other plans
I've got work to do

    I won't go back to the simple life
    The past is gone
    I won't go back to the simple life
    I'm moving on"
track_0162035,"The tide is on the brink of extinction
    The sky is on the verge of collapse
    The birds and the trees all are falling like leaves
    The memories are floating away

    The cabins on the shore are abandoned
    The streets are just a river of dust
    The ships on the bay all go sailing away
    And they won't be back here again"
track_0162038,"Cold hands, sore feet
You've been walking for an hour on abandoned streets

Weak knees, and fresh scars
It's a struggle when you're losing track of who you are

The words you stole won't save your soul
They can only buy you time

    Light a candle, or curse the dark
    It's all the same to me
    Start a fire, or drown the spark
    And shake away the heat
    Tell the truth or live a lie
    Just don't close your eyes

Let down, and so spent
You've been holding up the world with your good intent

Help out, like you should
It's a burden that you never really understood

But Caroline, I'm doing fine
It's the others who are dying

    Light a candle, or curse the dark
    It's all the same to me
    Start a fire, or drown the spark
    And shake away the heat
    Tell the truth or live a lie
    Be a burden or a prize
    Stick around or say goodbye
    Just don't close your eyes

And you're breaking
But you're faking nothing's ever wrong
And concealing what you're feeling
Always standing strong

But you don't need
To act like you don't bleed
When you come falling down
Cuz there is no healing when you're not feeling
Anything at all"
track_0162039,"In 1912, I was only a boy
Hardly 10 years old
The summer was dry, the sun in the sky
Where secrets burn like matches

In my Sunday best, I went down for a walk
To Billy Barnum's house
He was alone, no one was home
So I had an idea

    I said to Billy, ""let's go walking down in the ravine
    There's no one here for miles so we never will be seen
    If your folks are in Peoria, they won't be back for hours
    So let's go have some fun.""

We walked down through the tangle of trees
I lost my bearing twice
But then we emerged, the top of the earth
And watched in silent wonder

We stood tall on the edge of the bridge
When a gust of wind blew through
I stumbled and weaved, and reached for his sleeve
To try and find my balance

    But Billy lost his footing and he slipped off of the edge
    He caught himself with one hand on an overhanging ledge
    But his strength would only last him for a minute, maybe two
    Then he crashed down in the river
    He crashed down in the river

A shallow grave on the outskirts of town
Is where I laid him down
A secret it's stayed, what happened that day
With me and Billy Barnum
With me and Billy Barnum"
track_0162040,"Take this pill, my dear
It will keep you sharp and clear
The side effects won't last too long

It's stranger than it seems
In your most peculiar dreams
But it's nothing that won't fade with time

  Tuck the northern star in a candy jar
  And save it for a rainy day

    Shadows in the moonlight
    Always coming, always going
    While your cup is overflowing

    Shadows in the moonlight
    Just a matter of perspective
    It's all relative, subjective,
    It's alive

Stand up straight and tall
Keep your back against the wall
Remember what they said to you

A stranger in a crowd
A halo on a cloud
It's lost to you but it never really went away

  The muffled speech is out of reach
  But truth has got a way of breaking through

    [Chorus]

Take these words my dear,
And as they echo in your ears
It's closer than you think

    [Chorus x 2]"
track_0162042,"I saw your face, painted on the wall
Shapeless in space, colorless and small
        I remember you, faded and subdued

I spent the day, haunted by your sight
Hiding away, curse away the light
        I remember you, fading out of view

    You're a memory now
    You're all faded and brown
    You're just namelessly hung
    On the tip of my tongue in a silent remark

    You're a memory now
    You're just dust on the ground
    Just a whisper of steam on the crest of a dream
    While I walk in the dark
    You're a memory now

Sheltered and safe, hidden and concealed
Your timid face, never was revealed
        Shaded from the light, tepid and so slight

Shake off the dust, wipe away the years
Scrape off the rust, nothing more appears
        I've been through it all, still I can't recall
  
    [Chorus]"
track_0162043,"Take this down to where the streets are cold and nameless
Just be sure to watch your back cuz they will 
Find you and attack you without warning
There's trouble all around this place and danger in the strangest face
If you get lost along the way just close your eyes and softly say
The silent words you never heard when you were sleeping soundly in your bed

	They won't go away
	They don't leave
	They won't go away
	They don't sleep 

We have only just begun to see the future
In the corner of our eyes a little circle will arise and start to take you
The ships are sailing in the bay and they won't leave till they've been paid
And everyone's been bought and sold but no one's worth their weight in gold
It's only just a feeling but the devil has been dealing all the cards

	They won't go away
	They don't leave
	They won't go away
	They don't sleep"
track_0162044,"What's your favorite color?
Why does summer make you sad?
Do you crave the snow?
Where did you get your favorite pair of shoes?
Oh, I wanna know

All the things that make you sing
And tap your little toes
Oh, I wanna know

Did you cry when your father said goodbye?
Did he leave a note?
Do you scream when you wake up from a dream?
Oh, I wanna know

I want to hear between your ears
And swim inside your brain
Oh, I wanna know

    I want to know the thin and thick
    What makes you smile, what makes you tick
    I want to know what gets you out of bed
 
    Yeah, you're a mystery to me
    And I'm not asking for the key
    But I hope that you will let me in the door

Would you run if I told you you're the one?
Would you stay or go?
Could it be you've been waiting here for me?
Oh, I wanna know

Don't make me wait, just tell me straight
Before I have to go
Oh, I wanna know
Oh, I wanna know"
