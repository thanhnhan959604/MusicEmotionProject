track_1232343,"There I go again 
Just fighting with strangers
In a superior state of mind

You can blame it on the need of sedation
Because I’ve been working overtime

The words are just manliness defecation
In this senseless play on rhyme 

I can see the work but the world is blind 

There I go again screaming out her name
From the subtext of decline 
I’m in need of social detoxification 
Sublimely inclined
To ask for you a little bit of understanding
Because I’m holding on for life this time
I can see the world but the world is blind

Its an inferior design relying on emotions and little white lies
To change what the truth can never change…..it’s funny

You can deflect and be unkind tumble through the theories in your mind
It’s all a complicated game    that we all play      then throw away

I want you     I need you    I want to steal your heart away
You want me you need me but I’m too strange for you to stay

Yesterday was beautiful unpredictable I held your thoughts in mine
Today is quite uncomfortable and quite unusual I’m losing touch with time

Let’s go out for a little bit of fun and education
Let’s go out and have a good time

Let’s go out stop looking for a million dollar reason
To say you can’t be in my life"
track_1232347,"The tide was high
The air was cool
I complimented her under the full moon

I want you      I want you

The winds were calm
The stars were bright
I felt her rhythm merging with my life

I need you      I need   you

Seven days just intertwine with the thoughts of her racing on my mind

The day was hot
The air was dry
I great the morning with the love there in your eyes

I want you        I want you

The hours were short
The work was long
But in the morning I’ll be back in your loving arms

I need you      I need you

So as the story goes I’ll wait for you just as long as I have to cause girl I love you

My day was filled with thoughts of you every moment is like a dream come true

I need you          I need you

The night was filled with fireflies anticipating the next move in our lives

I want you          I want you

So as the story goes I’ll wait for you just as long as I have to cause girl I love you

Seven days just intertwine with the thoughts of you weighing on my mind"

No quiero despertar 
En una fría realidad 
No quiero nada mas 

//Que estar en tus brazos
Estar a tu lado y por siempre existir//

No quiero imaginar que todo sea un sueño y tenga despertar 

No quiero despertar 
En una fría realidad
No quiero nada mas 

//Que estar en tus brazos
Estar a tu lado y por siempre existir//

Acércame, acércame, acércame acércame...

Que estar en tus brazos, estar de tu lado y por siempre existir
Que andar de las manos y por siempre estar aquí junto a ti, junto a ti yo quiero ya vivir, yo quiero ya vivir..."

HE IS THE PICTURE OF MISERY
WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE SHE THROWS HIM OUT WITH KICKS

HE WAS A STAR FOR ALL THOSE YEARS
THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIMES
THE LORD OF BLOODY HELL AND FIRE
SHE NEEDS THE GLORY
WANNA BASK IN HIS FAME
BUT HE GOT OUT OF BUSINESS
JUST TO RETIRE
AND SHE'S IN A RAGE!

HE USED TO LIVE ACROSS THE STREET
NOW HE'S THE PICTURE OF MISERY
WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE SHE THREW HIM OUT WITH KICKS
I PICK HIM UP IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
AND I'M SHURE HE DOESN'T FEEL ALRIGHT
FOR THERE'S TROUBLE IN HOUSE NUMBER 666

AND HERE'S TO YOU MRS LUCIFER
SATAN LOVES YOU MORE THAN YOU WILL KNOW
I BEG YOU PLEASE MRS LUCIFER
YOUR DEVIL ALWAYS DOES THE BEST HE CAN - STAND BY YOUR MAN

HE USED TO LIVE ACROSS THE STREET
HE'S THE PICTURE OF MISERY
WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE SHE THREW HIM OUT WITH KICKS
I PICKED HIM UP IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
AND I'M SHURE HE DOESN'T FEEL ALRIGHT
FOR THERE'S TROUBLE IN HOUSE NUMBER 666

SO CRUEL, SO ROUGH AND COLD AS ICE
SHE'S A DEVIL - NO DISGUISE
REPLACING THE RULER BY THE RIVAL
'CAUSE SHE NEEDS THE GLORY
WANNA BASK IN HIS FAME
THEY CALL HIM ARCHANGEL
EXACT NAME MICHAEL
SO TELL ME WHO IS THE FOE?

THE MAN WHO LIVED ACROSS THE STREET
NOW HE'S THE PICTURE OF MISERY
WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE SHE THREW HIM OUT WITH KICKS
LUCIFER MOVES IN WITH ME
IT'S JUST AN ACT OF CHARITY
BUT THE EVIL STILL LIVES IN HOUSE NUMBER 666"

GLITTERING LIGHTS IN BUSY STREETS BUT DARKNESS IN MY MIND
FROM THE CROWD OF EMPTY SHAPES I HEARD AN ANGEL SPEAK:
""THERE'S NO NEED TO MOAN, I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU SEEK!""

AS MY EYES GREW HEAVY MY MIND SEEMED TO BE FREE
ATTENDED BY AN ANGEL SMILE - HOW HAPPY A MAN CAN BE!
ALL THE RANCOUR IN MY SOUL TURNED INTO LOVE AS YET
WITH THIS GIFT A HELENA IN EVERY GIRL I MET

SUPERFLUID DREAMS
TEARS OF SERAPHIM
MADE FOR THE SLEEPLESS
SUPERFLUID DREAMS
TEARS OF SERAPHIM
MADE FOR THE RESTLESS
HELP YOU TO GET THROUGH THE DAY
THEY KEEP YOU ALIVE
AND MAKE YOU DREAM THE NIGHT AWAY

WHEN I CAME ROUND THE SUN WAS SHINING RIGHT INTO MY EYES
I FOUND MYSELF FORSAKEN, MY HEAD FELT TWICE ITS SIZE
LYING IN THE GUTTER I HELD MY DICK IN THE HAND
NOTHING LEFT TO ME BUT PEARLY CUM INSIDE MY PANTS

SUPERFLUID DREAMS

YOU'RE NOT AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN ABOVE
YOU'RE ORDINARY

THE SUPERVAMP HAS TURNED INTO A FRUMPY BORE
YOU TELL ME I'M THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
BUT DO YOU KNOW ME AFTER ALL?

WHAT THE HELL MADE YOU THINK THIS WAS LOVE?
IT'S ONLY CHEMICAL
IT'S NOT A GODSEND FROM HEAVEN ABOVE
IT'S JUST MATERIAL

WHAT THE HELL MADE YOU THINK THIS WAS LOVE?
CAN'T YOU SEE
IT'S NOT A GODSEND FROM HEAVEN ABOVE
IT'S A TRAGEDY"

Please make sure that you hold on tight
I promise you it’s part of the script
Close your eyes, we’re going on a trip

Fall in love
for the first time in your life

In your life
In your life
Fall in love
for the first time in your life

According to your plans
You’ll go out there and find a man
Guaranteed, that you’ll never find anyone like me
Creating memories, fantasies,
romantically fulfilling all your needs 

We won’t keep our hands to ourselves
The most sensual adventure, 
is where will you let me venture 
It doesn’t matter how late it gets tonight
Answer my phone, you’re calling 
cause you want admit that you’ve fallen 


Reach out and join me on this journey
Let me prove to you I’m worthy of your love
Right now is the chance to make that jump, 
Do all the things you’ve never done, in your life

In your life
In your life 
Fall in love
for the first time in your life
In your life
In your life
Fall in love
for the first time in your life

Headed toward parts unknown
For the first time, we walk alone
Instantly, we start holding each other comfortably
Meeting adversity, uncertainty, and all kinds of possibilities
 
If you’re not sure
About this love
I won’t blame you 
if you pack it all up

If you believe 
and you’ve looked within
stand next to me, cause I know 
You’re all in"
track_1235674,"Trust, Touch and Honesty
Are things i know you need
Laughs, Hugs, a little Luck
Make Up the Elements of Love
Elements, Elements, The Elements of Love
Elements, Elements, The Elements of Love

The secret to this recipe
is the chemistry that we seek
Infatuation, Conversation, zz
And don't forget some more flirtation

Baby I know I mix with you
And you've got a positive reaction too
The formula is you and me 
Now we are here let's make some history


I know you're all about this
Cause i made a chemical analysis
Of your feelings, I'm academic
Our love will never be synthetic

Girl, you are the the perfect form
I got no problem keeping you warm
I never thought of us as plutonic
Your love's energy is atomic"
track_1235675,"You whisper on the phone
Knowing your man’s at home
I was your secret in the bed
But your man didn’t know you wanted me instead

Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The mess that you made for yourself now baby
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The decision you made so carelessly
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The promise to me that you don’t intend to keep
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	Two men who love you, one of them being me

You’re sneaking in late, quietly
Trying not to wake your family
They thought you were working overtime
But we were carrying on this lie

Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The mess that you made for yourself now baby
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The decision you made so carelessly
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The promise to me that you don’t intend to keep
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	Two men who love you, one of them being me





I think i have fallen so fast for a woman,
Who can’t love me

I’ll make it easier for you baby
And leave so you can live

oohhhh


Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The mess that you made for yourself now baby
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The decision you made so carelessly
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	The promise to me that you don’t intend to keep
Baby you’re Stuck in Between
	Two men who love you, one of them being me"
track_1235676,"The blood you drew
It didn't mean that much to you
Never held back a single word
You tried to take over my world

I tried to protect my heart and watch my back
Every time you advanced
Your eyes always attacked


The cuts you made were emotional
You know your love was delusional
It’s clear now that you’re unpredictable

Your decisions were irreversible
Your power was uncontrollable
Now i know that you’re unpredictable, unpredictable 


I stood up tall 
And I defended my walls
With the reasons our love 
Will eventually fall 

I know you wanna, I know you wanna fight for what we got
I knew there wasn’t a chance
The moment you fired the first shot

The loveshed and the bloodshed
We had our vows, but instead
I fell asleep alone in our bed

I’ll dream until there is peace
and hope our battle will cease,
Please know that i’m willing to fight for you and me"

closing off my mind
i did it every time
too scared to care
the clarity like sunlight warm and new
green in my lungs
i can't get enough of you
i wanna feel love
do you know 
this is not how i figured things would go
my heart was on fire
a paper lantern higher and higher"
track_1246471,"running from place to place
up and leave without a trace
before it gets too late
wanderlust would carry me away
sure i could dream
but as lonely as that seems
i am present tense
if only heaven was true
then i would pray
it's a saturday in June
and i get to spend it all with you
time will never solve everything
but it helps to figure out the subtleties 
in thoughts like these
so we listen to our parents
so much that living scares us
we share everything
it seems so careless
when all i want to do 
is run away with you"

track_1249603,"Des années et un jour, que je cherche ta bouche
Une vie orpheline, sans ton corps qui me touche
Les saisons à rebours et jamais le mois d'aout
Mes cicatrices opalines, mes espoirs en déroute
Sous une pluie d'étoiles, tu m'as parlé de nous
Cassiopée est témoin, sans crainte et sans tabous
Hissé la voile, mis le cap sur l'île au trésor,
Main dans la main, cœur contre cœur, conquistadors
L'amour est un esquif, fragile face aux révifs,
les sirènes, nos lâchetés, fausses promesses apocryphes
Nos peines indélébiles, nos veines, notre adn
Pour nous mener vers l'horizon, quel auster, quelles brises
Sous une pluie d'étoiles, tu m'as parlé de nous
Cassiopée est témoin, sans crainte et sans tabous
Hissé le voile, mis le cap sur l'île au trésor,
Main dans la main, cœur contre cœur, conquistadors
Cyan ton regard, des mers du sud imaginaires,
Des infinis voyage que nous rêvons de faire
Mais qu'en fermant les yeux, pour que tu reviennes
J'ai vécu mille et cent fois, pour vaincre la haine.
Sous une pluie d'étoile, tu m'as parlé de nous,
Cassiopée est témoin, sans crainte et sans tabous
Sorcier vaudou, tu m'as jeté un sortilège
Main dans la main, âmes enlacés, mon privilège."
track_1249602,"Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
au dessus des toits
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
que tu vois le monde en bas
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
Juste toi et moi
- -Traverse des épais nuages
De grandes tempêtes à affronter
S'envoler vers d'autres mirages
Notre aventure va continuer
On fera cap vers le grand large
Et on continuera d'avancer
Pour que s'éblouissent nos visages
Voir le bonheur se profiler
- -Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
au dessus des toits
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
que tu vois le monde en bas
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
Juste toi et moi
- -On se perdra sur des rivages
Ou l'on pourra se retrouver
Toi tu regardes notre sillage
Moi je ne pense qu'à te scruter
Je suivrai les nombreux virages
Que notre amour aura tracée
Pour que s'éternise notre voyage
Voir notre amour se dessiner
–
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
au dessus des toits
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
que tu vois le monde d'en bas
Je m'envolerai, je t'emmènerai
Juste toi et moi"

track_1250086,"Someday
in somewhere
you can find me
alone...
If your heart speaks to me,
my soul speaks to you,
oh yeah

What can I do?
Design my time
what can I feel
I feel the lie.
What can I say?
I say: My love,
what can I dreaming
I dream a lot

I don't have the light,
don't have the shine
The sun has turned off again

This song destroys the light,
this song destroys the lie.
This song destroys the air
This song destroys the life.
All this song can destroy the Sun
All this song can save  my life
All this song can destroy light
All this song can change my life,
save my life away."

Holding onto shadow, an unknown desire

Just one more try and I will fight
Sit staring deeply through the still of night
Digging deep, trying to find you
Neverending searching for you
Endlessly
In the endless blue

Waiting all my life
Holding onto this one belief
Looking in all the wrong places
I've seen so many faces
Yet I know you're hiding out there somewhere unseen

Slashing through the noise
Of this I have no choice
Yet still there's nothing to show
I'm going on this feeling
Yet inside my mind's reeling
I know you're out there somewhere
I can feel you here
So come on!"
track_1255457,
track_1255458,"I'm feeling this now
The full-on disassociation
What you said to me all those times
All a misappropriation
Little did I know it meant
My life's degeneration

In those waters I saw a sweet little angel
I'd continue that night together
If only I were able

The ocean
Holds all my hopes and all my dreams
Nothing is as it seems
Now in the ocean our love sleeps

I fear I forgot to mention
My minor apprehension
The time we came to part
Was the time all hell would start

Yet on the night of the ocean
Floating in the waters of salvation
We became lovers
Yet that would bring with it pain, I discovered

The ocean
Holds all my hopes and all my dreams
Nothing is as it seems
These waters are forever
This endless ocean in my dreams
As I looked into her eyes
I wore not one disguise
I hope she knows how much she meant to me
Now in the ocean our love sleeps"
track_1255459,"Listen to me
I believe our time is up
Unless you prove me wrong
Then this love is corrupt
You're never home
That which is my heart
This barren land
You've chosen not to roam

I've tried to give you my company
But I see that's something you won't accept
What you see is shaped by your beliefs
I wish I believed in us, except

I already know that it's over
So I'll try my best not to make believe
I feel alright, though I'm not sober
I'm drowning in this misery
So God please set me free

God please set me free

I beg of you, as I watch my bitterness flow
Just take my hand and allow our love to grow
This is the hardest I've fallen
Now surrounded by gloom
I'd much rather you be here
To help cure these wounds
I'm lying in this half dead coma
Waiting for my heart to beat
I feel as though I've dug my final home
In the back of love's retreat

So won't you set me free?
Please set me free from this
I know what I believe shapes what I see
So please won't you save me
And release me from this

So God please free me!

I already know that it's over
So I'll try my best not to make believe
I feel like hell and I'm far from sober
I'm drowning in this misery
So God please free me"
track_1255460,"A young boy sits alone
He always knew he'd grow up to leave home
It's his love he must follow
He moved away at eighteen
And all along was waiting
It's his love he must follow

I lie and dream this wondrous dream
And stare to the skies above
I've realized that I've got nothing left but love
For this place

Sitting in the sand
Holding my daughter's hand
I feel overjoyed
There's no place quite like here
In the past I neglected
But now I give it the respect it deserves
Home is really where the heart is

I wear my heart upon my sleeve
And shed a tear of joy
I've realized that I've got nothing left but love
For this place"

Give one more chance  to me

Try to see you again!
