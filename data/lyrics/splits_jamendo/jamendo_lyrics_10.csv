track_1164775,"I WANT YOU TO COME HOME



I close my eyes and
i try to think about nothing
as i´m playing the guitar,
but is not the moment.

Outside might be cold and
inside it´s so warm.

I stand up and see through the window
people are already wearing their hats and gloves.
There is no reason to go (get) out,
today i´m gonna stay home.

I feel up to nothing
It´s a pity to waste time this way.
I can´t help it or maybe i can,
i´m not really sure.

The only thing i really know 
is that i want you to come home.

The only thing i don´t know
is whether you´ll really come home."

track_1165468,"Each morning I look over
To find you
Your eyes closed
Head on the pillow
Softly breathing
I kiss your cheek
Repeatedly
Until you open your eyes
And look at me

Sometimes you flip over
Not wanting to get up
Sometimes you sit up
And give me a hug
Either way
We start each day
With love

I know how lucky I am
I wish love for everyone

Sometimes it comes
In unexpected places
Sometimes it comes
From observing nature
Either way
Please start each day
With love

We’re all just people doing what we can
To live our lives and find some happiness
We’re all just people doing what we can
Searching for others who really understand

Sometimes it’s hidden
Masked in sadness
Sometimes we’re alone
And we’re all we have
We are all we have
Either way
Please start each day
With love
Please love yourself
With love
Love yourself."
track_1165470,"This lack of validation
Absorbs to the core
When love is dishonored
Commitments ignored
How can I find value
In culture based on hate
How can I feel freedom
Laws don’t protect me

And my love
My love
The reason I’m alive
Oh my love
My love
The strength to survive
While we hide
And are forced to lie
The part of my life
That matters the most
Is summarized
With heart-stopping lies

We follow society
The American dream
Have jobs, bought a house
Mow the grass every week
We follow the law
Pay our taxes every year
But we both mark single
As if our love isn’t real

CHORUS

We just want our love protected
We just want to be respected"
track_1165472,"I heart your brain more than anything
I love your words and your thoughts
I’d give the breath that I need to breathe
If it would help you live

Oh my baby
Do you know what you mean to me?
Oh my baby
Do you feel all you’re worth?

Ooooooo… I heart your brain
Ooooooo…Puts the rest to shame
Ooooooo… I heart your brain
Ooooooooo…

I heart your brain more than anything
I love the way you connect the dots
I’d color in the lines and everything
If it would help you- la, la, la, la, la

Oh my darlin’
Do you hear my heart poundin’?
Oh my darlin’
Do you feel my heart beat?

Ooooooo… I heart your brain
Ooooooo…Puts the rest to shame
Ooooooo… I heart your brain
Ooooooooo…

I heart your brain more than anything
I love the way it computes
I’d give the memory I have in me
If it would help you boot

Oh my lovey
Do you feel the intensity?
Oh my lovey
I’ll love you for all eternity
Oh my love, my love

Ooooooo…

I heart your brain more than anything
I love your words and your thoughts"
track_1165473,"The most generic thing
I could say to you
Don’t mean a thing
Without the feelings between us two
I love you, I love you

The most over-used, over-hyped three words
Seems like everyone I ever met
Just really wish they heard
I love you
We wanna hear: I love you

We can’t get enough of this lovey dovey dove
Every movie and TV show
Regurgitates what we want
They’re sayin’: I love you
Change the channel, you’ll hear: I love you

Kittens and puppies, birdies and monkeys
Don’t need verbal language
To say how much the love ya’
Meow, meow, meow, woof, woof
(Whistle) ooo, ooo, ooo

I’ll keep sayin’ it again and again
And then I’ll keep sayin’ it until my life ends
Redundant for sure, uninventive perhaps
If I vowed to discontinue, I’d most certainly relapse, relapse, relapse

I love you, I love you
A little bit faster now: I love you
Faster still: I love you
Now like lightning baby: I love you
Faster than the speed of light: I love you
I love you x 12
Ooo… Ooo…

The most generic thing
I could say to you
Don’t mean a thing
Without the feelings between us two"
track_1165474,"How can someone love someone else
If they don’t even love themselves?
Find a lover who’s patient
While you deal with all your shh…
If you don’t really know you
How can you expect someone else to?
Guess you gotta get lucky
Really, really lucky
Like I did, yeah I did
And I hope you are too.

There are things that I can change
Things that stay the same
Things that can improve
Things I just can’t do
But I can love you and you can love me
And that makes us
So very lucky.

In the dead of summer
Near 100
Sky went pitch black
Trees swayed and snapped
Rain poured on down
Thunder was a deafening sound
‘Til the power went out
All we heard were our beating hearts
And I knew once again
If it were our end
I was lucky
Really, really lucky
To have the love of my life right beside me

There are things that I can change
Things that stay the same
Things that can improve
Things I just can’t do
But I can love you and you can love me
And that makes us
So very lucky.

Well, it’s way more than luck, yeah
Way more than love
It’s a willingness to open yourself up
Take the time
To understand
To learn your love
Everything you can.

There are things that I can change
Things that stay the same
Things that can improve
Things I just can’t do
But I can love you and you can love me
And that makes us
So very happy."
track_1165475,"When I see couples in the movies
They never seem to look like you and me
When we’re picking foods to put
Into our grocery cart
Other peoples carts of food
Never look like ours
When we’re spending time with folks
Who share our lines of blood
The way they act
How their paired up
Is never quite like us.

I’m saying we’re unique
Just like everybody else
But when we are together
For me there’s nothing else
That compares
At all.

When I see people
How they dress and what they do
They never seem to look or do
The same as me and you
When we’re asked the basic questions
People always ask
Our answers never seem to be
What they want from us
When I hear random people
Speaking with their loves
They never seem to speak as tender
As words between us.

I’m saying we’re unique
Just like everybody else
But when we are together
For me there’s nothing else
That compares
At all.

I’m definitely biased
When it comes to you
There’s nothing you could say or do
To change my love for you
If I someday bore you
Become intolerable
I wish for you to leave me
And find someone better just because
I love you
All the way
I do.

I’m saying we’re unique
Just like everybody else
But when we are together
For me there’s nothing else
That compares
At all."
track_1165476,"I think you knew me before I really got to know me.
And I’m pretty sure I got you the moment we met.
I think it has to do with your eyes.
Yeah, those bright blues hypnotize,
But I’m talking ‘bout the feelin’ of deep, deep knowin’…
If only a person looks.

Is it possible to love you more?
More love than I thought I had in store
More love than I thought I had inside of me.
Every day that passes by
Every look you look that meets my eyes
These years and still I love you more.

To say that I adore you
While it’s very, very true
Hardly explains what I feel for you
If I made a list, like I’ve done before
The reasons I feel affection for
You and I would be trapped inside for days…
Hey, hey…

Is it possible to love you more?
More love than I thought I had in store
More love than I thought I had inside of me.
Every day that passes by
Every look you look that meets my eyes
These years and still I love you more.

All you’ve done for me
You’ve kept me alive
All my thanks could never be
Enough.

Is it possible to love you more?
More love than I thought I had in store
More love than I thought I had inside of me.
Every day that passes by
Every look you look that meets my eyes
These years and still I love you more."

You got my head spinning
You got my palms sweating
You got my mind racing
My eyes dilated
My breath syncopated
My dopamine pulsing
Serotonin pumping

Your pheromones make me moan
Your pheromones make me moan
Your pheromones make me moan
Oh yeah- yeah- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We hit it off in two seconds flat
Your words were candy, thoughts all that
You reeled me in for a kiss so sweet
Marked the beginning of you and me

Pressure pounding in my head
Pressure building on my chest

Of dominance, war, hate

Just a sip of wine to melt the stress away
Oh- it’s so good for your health

Just a glass"
track_1167876,"Each morning I look over
To find you
Your eyes closed
Head on the pillow
Softly breathing
I kiss your cheek
Repeatedly
Until you open your eyes
And look at me

Sometimes you flip over
Not wanting to get up
Sometimes you sit up
And give me a hug
Either way
We start each day with love
With love

I know how lucky I am
I wish love for everyone

Sometimes it comes
In unexpected places
Sometimes it comes
From observing nature
Either way
Please start each day with love
With love

We’re all just people doing what we can
To live our lives and find some happiness
We’re all just people doing what we can
Searching for others who really understand

Sometimes it’s hidden
Masked in sadness
Sometimes we’re alone
And we’re all we have
We are all we have
Either way
Please start each day with love
With love
Please love yourself
With love
Love yourself
With love, with love"
track_1167877,"We may have different
Philosophies
But we share
One binding belief
In love, in love
Music through love
In love, in love
Music through love

We can learn a deeper love
Creativity, sharing, warmth
Expand our minds
Open our hearts
Accept each other for who we are
We can be the peace we crave
Make our world a loving place
Embrace each other with open arms
Love each other from the very start, yeah
We can live our lives this way
Feel the love absolve all the hate
Find the truth in unity
Spread our love eternally

We may have different

In love, in love
Music through love

I’m going in for the bread like a hot dog
sweat on the track when i lace no race dog
dog, I’m coming for everything
can't wait to get mine, seen the bottom of everything
started from the bottom, but i ain’t ever got there
waiting for a long time, sh** is crazy out here
yeah, this is a bar to be underlined
I’m about mine still, I’m dying on the line
before you hit me with the feather line,
I’m aiming for that britney type money no federline,

I’m a grown man never been a patsy,
born in the rain, still hear it dropping
feel the vibe , come on let track sing sing sing

Hook (Rebekka Salomea)

All my life, I’ve been waiting fighting hard just to get some
All my life, I’ve been waiting for so long imma take me there (2X)

Verse 2 (Jaief)

j to the f, still hovering the game
just wanna sell my own story, but ditch on the fame
wrapped up in all these illusions, call me david blaine
when chasing dreams milestones could drive you insane
all my life, didn’t try to belong
i chose to get my own opinion, what’s right and what’s wrong
I’m human, always wanted some more
been to bangkok, now i wanna do singapore
my uncle told me don’t rush it
life gives you lemons, make lemonade of it
Andrew told me bruh, GOD is in control of it
me honestly i don’t like the pace of it
i did follow my dreams
it’s like I’m almost there, yet i ain’t feeling like C.R.E.A.M
damn this feel of discontent bad, it’s killing me
this song’s my way to therapy me

track_1169941,"Verse 1 (Asong)

I had to sit and write a letter, to Mr. Asong
always pain in my heart, since the day you been gone
you promised to stay with me you'd never leave alone
you created a family, now my momma alone
now she seen a lot hardship pushing us through
she passed out at burial , i ain’t know what to do
and my little brother and sisters, was crying as hell
that’s one, hell of a story i don't know how to tell
somebody tell me where you at now? life is scary
after everything you did trying make us merry?
hardly understand this sh**, did you run out of breath?
why are we happy for a birth, when there’s gonna be a death?
What’s our, purpose on earth, what’s the reason for life?
why do we breath in and breath out? why am i alive?
well, you play by your scripts, till the end of your movie
Imma live to carry your name till the end of my move, Rest In Peace!

Hook

you’ve worked tirelessly, perhaps now it’s time to take a rest, yes
Rest in Peace (Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace)

Rest in Peace (Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace)
Rest in Peace (Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace)

Verse 2 (Jaief)

I’m in the mood right now to talk about it, that part of my life
rainy days, mary j in my life
this life, oh what a beautiful lie
you live, learn, and then f****** die
last year my uncle passed away
and i ain’t get a chance to tell him, i appreciate your passive ways
i was a teen, trying to find my own way
parents on my ass, wanting me they own way
then you came through, fresh out of no where
backstreet boys, I knew i want it that way
I’m all grown now, turned to beast
life's turned me into a masterpiece
want you to know, you can go ahead and rest in peace
watched you struggle all these years just to get some peace
I’m still here, repping for you
matter of fact, I’m out tonight i'll make a toast to you

Hook

Bridge (Jaief Narrating)

thing is, i never wished myself a long life
the thing i did wish myself, is a good life and a merry one
for some reason, life turns out to be good to some people, and just sad for some
and sometimes i feel like i'd rather leave, than stay and live with some kind of pain
i done lost a few people who did mean something to me
through death, friends grown apart, break up
it is what it is .... rest in peace

Drawn by the magic of two hearts agreeing

Mist rolls gently from a lazy sea
And settles lightly on you and me
Bare foot, contentedly ragged
We gaze in different ways
Yet I’ve never felt so close to you
In this last best phase

Breath of love overspreads my being
It finds its way by touch, not seeing

I’m looking at you but your eyes belong
To the delicate pencil-stroke horizon
I want to stay in this moment
I want to know what happens next
‘Cause together we can write
The most unexpected text

Breath of love overspreads my being
Finding its way by touch, not seeing
Breath of love overspreads my being
Drawn by the miracle of two hearts agreeing

Seconds drop, one by one
Into the long ribbon of time
Sitting apart, always connected
You were worth the wait and climb

Breath of love, it takes a hold
Gets in your blood and fills your soul
Relax, and watch your life unfold
Breath of love!"

windy days and rainy nights
stormy weather what a bummer
four o clock switch on the lights

seems the world has gone to sleep
seems i need a place to keep
warm all my fingertips and feet
all underneath
need an extra pair of shoes
fixing holes shake off the blues
or go under

mourning the sun
living for the one
i am coming around
honestly though
if i didn't really have you
would i stay sane and sound

leaves are blowing down the driveway
sleeping in staying in bed
nightly driving on the highway
taking all that we can get

get away from black and white
i need you to be alright
come and hold me while you might

mourning the sun
living for the one
i am coming around
honestly though
if i didn't really have you
would i stay sane and sound

let us just be on our own
never answering the phone
better yet not be at home
let us walk along the coast
to the place we love the most

be my lighthouse night and day"

strolling round the shops
with nothing but the song that i was singing
passed by a boutique
heard somebody speak
turned out that it was me he was adressing

he'd caught my chan-
ting as he began
to formulate a brainwave he was having
took me by the hand
tried to make me understand
i had to follow him to his building

later - studio
performing on a show
it has been a hell ride of a day

but
i don't want to be a rock star
i just wanna sing my song
i don't care whether you love me
i don't get why people sing along

i don't want to be a rock star
i just rather wish i ain't
it's never how you think
can't just have a silent drink
so i don't wanna be a rock star

all the money in the world
fancy cars and girls
but no time for coffee in the morning
alcoholic star
thanks to my p.r.
children let this be a warning

cancel the interview
i am going to the zoo
that is something i would rather go for
instead of nicotine
bodyguard and limousine
bly me, rather sneak out the back door

don't want to be a rolling stone
i just want to go home
and not be on the poster on your wall

My soul is like the oar that momently
 Dies in a desperate stress beneath the wave,
Then glitters out again and sweeps the sea:
 Each second I'm new-born from some new grave."
track_1186843,"Sorrowing Love - Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923)

And again the flowers are come,
And the light shakes,
And no tiny voice is dumb,
And a bud breaks
On the humble bush and the proud restless tree.
Come with me!

Look, this little flower is pink,
And this one white.
Here's a pearl cup for your drink,
Here's for your delight
A yellow one, sweet  with honey.
Here's fairy money
Silver bright
Scattered over the grass
As we pass.

Here's moss.  How the smell of it lingers
On my cold fingers!
You shall have no moss.  Here's a frail
Hyacinth, deathyly pale.
Not for you, not for you!
And the place where they grew
You must promise me not to discover,
My sorrowful lover!
Shall we never be happy again?
Never again play?
In vain--in vain!
Come away!"

track_1187346,"Two Wolves - A Cherokee Parable 

An old Cherokee chief was teaching his grandson about life... 

""A fight is going on inside me,"" he said to the boy. 
""It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. 

""One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, and ego. 

""The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. 

""This same fight is going on inside you - and inside every other person, too."" 

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, 

""Which wolf will win?"" 

The old chief simply replied, 

""The one you feed."""
track_1187640,"I want you back,
I know writing 'bout it won't bring you home

But I can't think straight
Maybe letting it out this way helps, I don't know

Wish I had something, to sing about
I've got nothing to sing about

So here we go again,
I've been avoiding this for nearly a year
I go to work, I lie to all of my friends

Wish I had something else to sing about, I've got nothing to sing about

365, a web of lies
And you tore it all down
I was just blind, ran out of time
People change and they drift apart

So here we go again
I was drinking all night with a heavy heart
I made some new friends
Conversations about sleeping patterns, I don't know

Wish I had something else to sing about, I need something to sing about"
track_1187641,"Why don't you wear your summer dress?
The one you wore when we first met
The weather's perfect now for walking
It's days like these that I feel blessed

It's the simple things in life
That can make a life worth living
Sometimes that's what I, feel like I've been missing

We never talk quite like we used to
People move so fast that they forget
Sometimes it's better to do nothing
Take a little time to reassess

It's the simple things in life
That can make a life worth living
Sometimes that's what I, feel like I've been missing"
track_1187642,"Don't wanna sleep today, I've been getting lonely inside my bed
Can't escape my head, I'll spend a little while outside instead

I don't recognize your face, even though you call me we'd only be misled
I don't feel the life inside this space without all the love you gave me

I hope it's understood, I didn't mean to cause a fallout
I know you tried, but you didn't really want it that way
I hate the regret, I never wanna feel this again
I'm hitting rewind, to start on over

In a moment, the world leaves you behind
You can't control it, so find a place to hide

Don't wanna talk today, I feel a slight uneasy 'bout what I'd say
I know I can't complain, all the love around me's a saving grace

I don't recognize this place, so far behind I'm losing in this race
I don't recognize the hate, there's nothing in this world that justifies it

I hope you know, I miss you and I want you around
But I can't stay, it hurts me that I'm feeling this way
I can't be friends, I'm sorry but it just won't work
I can't forget, I can't start over

In a moment, your friend leaves you behind
You can't control it, a love that somehow dies"

You’re my light in the night
You’re my Spanish desire

Your eyes…I can drown in love
Your smile…It can make me blush
Your gait… With U I’m taking off
For U.. I can be so hush

I won't let you relax, Max x4

When I hear Ur tender voice
When I see Ur modern style

Такого милого, самого любимого
Бутербродик и чай, «Милая вставай»
А я прошу: «Ну еще пообнимай»
Утро шепчет «Проснись, быстрей взбодрись,
В новый день с победами скорей ворвись»
Этот день я начну с улыбки каждому
И тебя крепко-крепко обниму

Припев:
Никому не отдам тебя, запомни,
Я точно помню каждую полночь
Никому не отдам тебя, запомни теперь
Мы с тобою вместе будем вечно,
Ночью нам расскажут звезды и путь млечный
Мы с тобою вместе будем вечно, поверь

Знаю, это судьба смотреть в твои глаза
Понимать, что вместе будем всегда
Обнимать друг друга по утрам
Быть назло всем вьюгам и врагам (холодам)

Припев

Ты поверишь мне, а я – тебе и весна в душе
Стреляет точно милый Амур, ты не будешь хмур
И неважно, какая погода, нам классно вместе в любое время года
И неважно, какая погода теперь"

It makes me realize that my
Life's just a play
So listen what I'll say!

Hide my fears into the shelf
But I see, it brings me down (Down, down, down…)
All my troubles seem unsolved
I asked how but no one told
Feeling like I'm going 'round.

I saw a fallen angel as light embraced my empty soul
So full of sorrow
Lost in the pain and anger ,trapped by the nails of father death
In seas so hollow
The path was layed before me, the stars had paved the only road
For my redemption
Quick dand and thorns on my side, my consciousness till my last breat
One lost affection

There's something buried inside my mind
That songs of old challenge me to find deep in my dreams
Deliver passion and lust for life
The sacred flame will forever and ever be mine
Now its starting to rain again
And every drop falling on my skin tears me apart
Since empty skies have condemned me now
I find my self coming closer and closer to the ground

It starts with pain and with splinters growing deeply throughout my spine
The cleansing process begins, the suffering I must feel is mine
A simple task for the souless body covered in scars of hate
The agony of awaiting all the signs that reveal my fate

The sun shines before me now
It's rays appear out of the ground
The angels start to call me
Their voices clear they becon me

And as I float towards the light
An endless overwhelming flight
A loving veil surrounds me
Hatred will never find me again"
