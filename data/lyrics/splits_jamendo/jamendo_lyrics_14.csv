track_1302668,"long time ago
big city dreams, years and years 
away from now
but i ain't shedding any tears
where i grew up
neighborhood and sunday school
out of the mud
i pulled myself together and left

and when i woke up in the night
touched by soft and shimmering red light

on the way back from l.a. 
i'm shaking my curly hair
on my way back from l.a.
and still smiling
on my way back from l.a.
i've got the radio on
and i listen to a song that i wrote back then

what a dive
just the place to be for someone like me
an endless high
nights and days and songs and ways to play
another life
another way of life so different
behind my eyes 
was so much going on

and when i woke up in the night
touched by soft and shimmering red light

on the way back from l.a.
i'm shaking my curly hair
on my way back from l.a.
sunglasses
on my way back from l.a.
i've got the radio on
and i listen to a song that i wrote for someone i knew back then

i don't regret anything
although you might deny
there's an end to everything
all good times go by
what's left are the memories

on the way back from l.a.
i'm shaking my curly hair
on my way back from l.a.
a new beginning
on my way back from l.a.
i've got the radio on
and i know i'll be fine as long as my tyres are spinning"
track_1302145,
track_1302669,"short after christmas time	
twenty nine, twenty nine
i had a friend of mine
movie and a glass of wine
just like a cannonball it hit me
what a brilliant surprise
suddenly got weak around the knees

now i wonder

what are the odds we met
what could have been instead
what if it was inside my head
what if the drill had been dead

out of the blue 
winter dozed spring was close
add to my flow
late night walks hour-long talks
just like a saviour descending
comeing to pull me up
we never made it to the ending

now i wonder

what are the odds we met
what could have been instead
what if the night had turned to ash
what if the drill had been dead

stammering and far from making any kind of sense
the only thing that i could feel the movement of her hands

what are the odds we met
what could have been instead
what if the night had turned to ash
what if the drill had been dead

what if there had been no time
what if you had not had wine
what if the night had turned to ash
what if we hadn't started fresh"
track_1302671,"an early morning we went 
spring vacation as the
sun cut the horizon
and I noticed how beautiful you are

car on a train
chocolate and chapagne
what a day
car on a train

little chucks they gave
rhythm to the sound
of a thousand tons 
moving overground

car on a train
shooting down the lane
sunshine and rain
car on a train

pull that string and there'd be a lot more time
but as i'm afraid the quality would decline
it's a crazy thing, one of us has to drive
we are so living in the moment

car on a train
chocolate and chapagne
what a day
car on a train

car on a train
simple and plain
sunshine and rain
car on a train"
track_1302672,"fastening the chain and
keep me in the rain
deserving makes it all go away
that is what you get 
for chasing the postman
take me to the kennel and i'll stay

i'll take my sweet cut
sitting in the wee spot
looking at night and day
you'll be the queen and
i'll be licking your hand
now and for the rest of the way

barking at the great wide
trees along the roadside
having the time of my life
come a little closer	
just a little closer
just a little more and i'll bite

i'll take my sweet cut
sitting in the wee spot
looking at night and day
you'll be the queen and
i'll be licking your hand
now and for the rest of the way

just seems so easy when i am your only friend
please take me out again or else i'll wet my pants

i'll take my sweet cut
sitting in the wee spot
looking at night and day
you'll be the queen and
i'll be licking your hand
now and for the rest of the way"
track_1302674,"the sun was shining brightly - when hasselhoff saved the day
i was having ice cream - when hasselhoff saved the day
that dog was just adorable - when hasselhoff saved the day
life was oh so horrible - then hasselhoff saved the day

woho - hasselhoff saved the day
woho - hasselhoff saved the day

someone had found some money - when hasselhoff saved the day
you were saying something funny - when hasselhoff saved the day
i took you out for waffles - when hasselhoff saved the day
everything was awful - then hasselhoff saved the day

woho - hasselhoff saved the day
woho - hasselhoff saved the day

thanks again for everything you did
guess our history books need to be refit
let's all celebrate the day of your birth
yippieyeah thanks you saved the earth

woho - hasselhoff saved the day
woho - hasselhoff saved the day"
track_1302677,"the moment that i first met you 
i knew it was gonna be a pile of work for me to do
when we first talked you said many things 
a lot of things i'd disagree and this would be

an extraordinary journey for you and me
so do you see at least there we agreed
your way was so different from mine and i
often wondered if i was gonna laugh or cry
 
one more helpless blunder	
one step from going under 
falling over feet and in the middle you and me
another runaway 
done, but anyway

i saved your life
now i', asking the angels to save mine
i gave it all got nothing back
now calling the angels
calling the angels help me
master the incline

i got you studying and everything
got you a place when you were worrying
you took it all and paid me nothing and
you still think i will carry on carrying
 
one more helpless blunder	
one step from going under 
falling over feet and in the middle you and me
another runaway 
done, but anyway

i made your life
now i'm asking the angels to make mine 
i gave it all got nothing back 
now calling the angels
calling the angels help me
master the incline

you are still part of me will always be
i'm still here still full of sympathy
but right now i'm on the brink, the razor edge
don't let me sink, talk me off the fucking ledge

i saved your life
now i don't need the angels to save mine
i just want you to make me whole
because i know to you i can consign my soul
my angel in control"
track_1302675,"i've seen a lot
good and bad	
black and white
wrong and right
what a circus

but what i've gotten
out of it
by my wit
is what i've found
under the surface

theres those nifty combinations that enchant me
and probably will do you to
a nifty combination what would be such a gem 
well, french kisses and cat hair is one of them

a single thing
single thought
that if caught
often is worth 
little on it's own

when they unite
then by chance
we get our hands
on something
to really set the tone

one thing is true
right away
makes my day
and so i say
i'm not gonna live without"
track_1302678,"do you know we are in a whirl
in only one of a billion worlds
on a course that noone
ever really set

said the nerd to the pretty girl
skipped a beat as she flipped a curl
maybe i am dreaming
i am already dead

here's a phrase she replied
i will need you to answer
are you sure that you know 
that you want what you wish for

whatever you dream of
chaos and commotion
dream of
devil and devotion
dream of
everything is nice
but i really gotta go

no don't go gimme one more
sorry i'm being such a bore
do you like magic
cause i can show you mine

alrighty clearly worse than before
just looking for an entry door
when i seem creepy
i'm only insecure

she was so gonna leave 
when suddenly thinking
i might have what you need
if you look for a spanking

whatever you dream of
chaos and commotion
dream of 
devil and devotion
dream of
everything is nice
but youre in for a world of pain
 
whatever you dream of
chaos and commotion
dream of
devil and devotion
dream of
everything is hurting
if you grant me the perversion

dream of 
learning from a goddess
dream of 
join in for the chorus
dream of  
be careful what you wish for
when you wish for me
when you wish for me"

With answers to the questions of the restless dead
There are dark thoughts circling in my head
I wish I’d listened to everything they said

The ghosts are here, they’re not laid to rest
They cluster round my bed at night and put me to the test
In some secret corner I knew I’d rue the day
I didn’t make more effort, I went my own way

The ghosts are here with their gift of guilt
My failures sewn together to make a shabby quilt
They say they forgive me – that I should forget
But I miss them still and I’ll always feel regret

The ghosts are here, needing to be fed
With answers to the questions of the restless dead
There are dark thoughts circling in my head
I wish I’d listened to everything they said

The ghosts are here, they’re not laid to rest
The ghosts are here, with their gift of guilt
The ghosts are here, the ghosts of December"

Dark when I come home
Living in artificial light
Brings me so far down

Memories and reality
Find their way to destroy me
Leaving me in misery
I can’t shake

(Chorus)
When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
I get down
Down, down, down

Everyone is buying things
Going to big parties
All I want to do is sleep
And hide

But nightmares wake me up
Haunted by spiraling thoughts
Just don’t see any joy
Or peace

When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
I get down
Down, down, down

Nothing that I do
Seems to change a damn thing
I’ll just keep pushing through
Until the light of spring

When the sun finally comes out
When the sun finally comes out
When the sun finally comes out
Lifts me up
Up, up, up, up, up…"

track_1307829,"Dance on the edge tonight

Hey, am I someone that you used to know?
Like I'm a ghost to see in a glow

And when I look at you in this dark
Yy eyes are flashing lights in the night

You like to keep me under control
Like now I'm out-of-box, watch it burn

I'm your forbitten thoughts. Set me free!
I'm your forbidden hopes. Make me real!

Let it go...

You're bleeding with adrenaline
Who would have thought that it could be real?

Cross the line and find out
The best night of your life

- - -

Dance on the edge tonight
can you feel it?

Out on the edge tonight
can you feel it?
This is freedom!

Oh baby, oh can you feel it?


- - -

I can drive your silent life to extremes
Just let me pinch your heart with a thrill


We rather taping point move on
The rather point of no return

Jump of the cliff all into the skies
And watch yourself drown in these blue eyes

And in this freefall find you wings
Oh in this freefall catch your dreams

Let it go
Can you let it go?
Let it go

Dance on the edge tonight
can you feel it?

Out on the edge tonight
can you feel it?
This is freedom!

you say you won’t do me no harm
when you start to hypnotise
i stumble and i fall in your arms 

there’s a down side to every lie
and mine go by the rule
thought i’d come &amp; make you smile
but i guess i was just a fool

i see the devil in your eyes
that’s why im leaving now
so far away from you
im sure you’ll find a shoe at your size

i wish i could break the spell
but it keeps coming back on me
whatever i might do
and whoever i might meet and tell


i wonder if i didn’t push rewind
turning off the evolution of my mind
oh yes i should go read a book or philosophy
on how to make things work before it dies
so i just left without goodbyes"

Waiting for this day to come
With it here we’re deer in headlights
Shocked and overwhelmed.
We really didn’t think that it would happen
Now we know just what we’ll do
We’ll join this once forbidden convention
And say, “I do, I do.”

CHORUS
‘Cuz we do
And we did
And we will
Like we have
All these years
That we’ve proved
Just how much
We really do
Yeah, I do
Mmm…

Feels like we just go the secret password
To get into the secret club
Can’t believe the judges really listened
Can’t believe they ruled in favor of love

CHORUS

BRIDGE
Don’t know if it will feel different
Having that official paper
But I know our love will finally count
And I know we’re getting closer
To respecting each other
And seeing that differences aren’t
We are just people after all
Seeking respect and seeking love

CHORUS

We are just people after all
Seeking respect and seeking love."

You took your time so slow 
and I don't mind, I don't know 
Why you just won't seem to let go 

Those words on you

This won't be quick to pass 

I don't notice 
The warning's come at last 
When no one wants you 
You'll get by somehow 

I watch the smoke rise from the roofs 
A distant signal can't renew 
The blackened soot on every street 
Doesn't mean anything 

When every movement makes you scared 
In going nowhere you can't disappear 
What you did to feel so low 
But you should not go down with me"

For the only thing we needed	

He fought a great war 

They built the statue 
When he was chemically treated 

With apples and Prussia blue 

Why sing for a finished mind 
When it's better to start again 

He built a hundred bombes 

Such fleeting fairy tales 
in a mirror of intelligence 

Broken by love's first kiss 

We found a universal machine 
We found a reason to be 

No lover with which to mend 
Just a darkness that doesn't stop

We found a reason to be

I've led a quiet life 
I don't know, but I've got my fingers crossed...

That's when you'll stay the same 
Get rid of this feeling 
I thought I'd never leave it 

In the place that we call everything 
There are parts of you that I have found 

It's a wind that's never gonna' stop 
You feel it blowin' from the underground 

And when your days change I know 
That's when you'll stay the same 
Get rid of this feeling 
I thought I'd leave it 

Baby, when I stare blankly into the endless void of your memory 
I can feel all of the life in my body slipping away 
Like tiny grains of sand spilling out from the broken glass that they themselves made 

And darling, 
When you reach out and touch my hand 
Everything evaporates"

superstition is cold
and I'm freezing in here
you are trapped in a world
of betrayal and fear

I can't make you feel good
and I know that I should

this depression you found
is a getaway plan
it's a one person home
for two people's demands

you just gotta believe
that there's life after grief

for this life you lead
is getting you nowhere
making you feel like a bum

I'm nothing at all
I'm everything you wanted
except for what I'm not

ammunition is fuel
for recovering troops
repetition is cruel
and we're stuck on a loop

I cannot understand
what has failed in this plan

all the errors you mention
I have buried and lost
I am mildly pretentious
at affordable costs

you just gotta believe
that there's life after grief

for the life we had
was leading us nowhere
we're starting all over again

track_1310653,"Walking Around With You In My Head

I feel so stupid, I don’t know what’s going on
I get so nervous and I'm biting on my tongue

I really don’t know why I’m singing about myself
When I only seem to think about somebody else

I’m going crazy without you
Not as if I wasn’t before, just more
And this is not an obsession or trying to get laid in your bed
It’s just walking around with you in my head

I feel so dumb I wanna write bad poetry
And all my rhymes are valentines lost at sea

I get the crazy feeling that I’m not alone
And even gangsters in the street are whistling this song

I get the feeling that I was born to ride my train on your track
So come back
So when we get to the station, we’ll swim in perspiration
You said ‘I’ve been walking around with you in my head’

This is such a happy song
This is such a happy song
So sing along

La la la la

I wonder if we care

down in your bad, bad memory's drive

put me on a train
put me on a train and send me rollin'
put me on a boat
put me on a boat and send me flowin'
down your bad, bad memory's drive

tie me to a chair
tie me to a chair and kick me over
lonely and scared
lonely and scared I'll be your lover
down your bad, bad memory's drive

track_1310657,"Kingdom Come

cannot change a lightbulb
cannot trust a friend
cannot stick to any kind of plan

cannot change direction
cannot make amends
cannot read the words in smaller print

and it feels like I'm having too much fun
hanging on to what you've done wrong
till kingdom come

men of good intentions
sow what they don't reap
digging holes to bury all the weak

cannot change a lightbulb
cannot trust a friend
cannot stick to any kind of plan

Wealth is the time 
That we always find 
For all the pointless waste 
But impressions only matter 

Even now 't feels blue 
The wooorld is what you 
Only can imagine. 
So better imagine it good. 

It seems to never be enough /х2 

No matter when it started It just 
matters how 
So care about It 
So Care about it. 

You are the reason why I wake up with a smile and Nothing more I am needing. 
Nothing can lift me up 
Except for kind words that I believe in 

No shining sun but it's yet morning now 
Tomorrow it can be late 
But afternoon is fine"

I want to share with you 
A slow dance 

And I put away my sorrow 
Not tomorrow 
It's time to follow 
Ursa Minor 
In my app to find you 

Do what you want 
Do what you want to do

I try to forget you babe
But it's only been ten days
I try to keep busy in my own way
Befriended by the echoed hallways

Cuz when you’re gone
Just trying to be a part of you
When you’re gone
just tired of being apart from you

If my eyes can arrest you babe
Tell me how you’re walking away
A sigh on a window pane
While you’re sitting in a cafe

Cuz when you’re gone
Just trying to be a part of you
When you’re gone
Tired of being apart from your

Have patience 
A better
And spacious way to be together
Putting this forever

All in a day
Always I’ll wait

I shy from a busy place
Lonely like a crowd in L.A.
Asides to my pillowcase 
Is it really about the chase?

Cuz when you’re gone
Just trying to be a part of you
When you’re gone
Tired of being apart from your

Have patience 
A better
And spacious way to be together
Putting this forever

All in a day
Always I’ll wait"

Chasing unattainable
Who are you? I’m nobody too

Too many paths to choose: only myself to lose

You can’t leave me like this—without knowing what it is.
You can’t leave me like this—without knowing what it is.
You can’t leave me like this—without knowing what it is.

We’re standing on the shoulders of giants
We haven’t touched the stars but we’re trying
And if we give ourselves, we forgive ourselves,
And if we forgive ourselves, we grow big ourselves.

Drag me down to the depths of possibility
Find me charming in my own delay—
—or was it yesterday?
These are the trappings of intention

You can’t leave me like this—without knowing what it is.
You can’t leave me like this—without knowing what it is.
You can’t leave me like this—without knowing what it is.

(We grow big ourselves)
I thought I was right, but I was wrong
(We grow big ourselves)
This was a part of the plan all along 
(We grow big ourselves)
I thought I was right, but I was wrong

Just leave me like this—I now know what it is
You can leave me like this— cuz I now know what it is
Just leave me like this—I now know what it is
Just leave me like this

I can take the old folks laughing, their knowing little smiles
I can take the talk about us, it’ll go away after a while
And I’ll be loving you, the only love I ever needed
when all is said and through. I think about you all the time
You know I do. How lucky I am
To be with you

And I hope you feel the same way twenty years from now
Glad we’ve found each other somehow.
A love like ours only come along one time if at all
The waiting on that one time really worth the fall.

Just want us to be together, two lives lived as one and I’ll be loving you.

Two days from life by a windswept sea was all we could ever steal

In that small back room I can hold you once more
The single place I want to be
I can leave my pain outside the door
In here you belong to me

We kept saying how lucky we’d met, some people never know bliss
But even then I knew my heart would die, I’d never get over this

And seaside towns in winter where I can just sit and brood on heartbreak
On heartache
On what a snake he was after all
And your sunshine, your sunshine’s getting in my way

You might think this new love is the one for you
Soon you realize it’s more a case of 'he'll do'
Turns out you’re not exactly charming the guy
In spite of all your concessions and mid-brown hair dye

Hey, Mr. Sun
Wish you’d take a hike
While I wait for my homicidal hostility to pass

When this old Creek’s wrapped in dusk’s embrace
It’s really almost pretty and then you can’t look in my face

Oh it’s so good to see you, say you’ll stay

They’re not my friends
More like family members
Causing regret whenever I rake over the embers

People always tell me
I’m an angry person inside
I keep an eternal flame burning
Wherever dark memory resides

I should bury the hatchet
Unsettle the score
But when I recall an injustice
I’m flexing my claws

Here they come round again
Those bitter thoughts of now and then
I’ve always been this way
I cling to the present
But I was made yesterday

It has been my experience
When stepping into the light
The next step might take you
To an endless night

Here they come round and round and round again
Those bitter thoughts of now and then

I cling to the present
But I was made long ago"
track_1319233,"You came and sat under my apple tree, a friend of a friend
Bringing neither wine nor roses, only something that you’d penned
I’d never been given anything so original before
I found out later it was by Sir Thomas Moore
You feasted in my garden, I never invited you
But you were charming and witty and a damned good screw

You stayed a long while, I couldn’t get rid of you
Singing day and night, you sewed sequins on my shoes
Painted my walls orange, made jelly from my apple tree
But you couldn’t keep a job and were no good for me
I ended that dream of summer, told you to leave one day
But oh your smile turned lead to gold and you were a bloody good lay"

I’m soft as a dove
His passion will burn me
Yet I’ll keep looking for love"

In my glass of garnet wine
Seems its face is full of sorrow

Make sail for that line
Where the sea kisses the sky

Now my glass has broken
Like my fractured heart and mind
I’ve a ticket marked for nowhere
And I’ll take it as a sign
To break away, make no last try
My fate lies on that line
Where the sea kisses the sky

My ticket’s marked for nowhere
I’ll take it as a sign
To sail away, sail for that silver line
Where the sea kisses the sky"

Beyond my feet

Chorus
So why am I here
What is it all about
Why does the world go ‘round
And is the sky still blue above
Now answer me this
Has it all been a lie
‘Cause how is it I still live
When I’ve never been alive

Life was always just a fact
No place for silly dreams
Those were just for other fools
At least that’s what it seemed
So I never thought to try
Never thought I had a choice
So I never gave my heart away
Never ever gave it voice

Chorus
So why am I here
What is it all about
Why does the world go ‘round
And is the sky still blue above
Now answer me this
Has it all been a lie
‘Cause how is it I still live
When I’ve never been alive

Never sat in the sun
Never named the stars above
Never stopped to smell the roses
I never made the time
Now my end has come
And all I’m left is regret
For I never told you how much I love you
So many things I never said

Chorus
So why am I here

If in daylight the bruises will be showing

Or risk the feel of the back of his hand
Broken jaw and broken nose
Surrender and fear are the way it goes

Chorus
Is the man lying low, is the beast on the rise?
Will she see the beast looking out, behind his eyes?

Verse
She tiptoes around him, keeps her mouth shut
He’ll use any excuse to call her a slut
Every minute, every hour, she expects the next blow
No one’s ever wanted her, there’s no place to go
That’s why he chose her, she must be to blame
Because right from the start, her daddy was the same

Chorus
Is the man lying low, is the beast on the rise?
Will she see the beast looking out, behind his eyes?

Bridge
She’s a mealy-mouthed victim
A trembling rabbit in a cage
There’s no rhyme or reason
To what goads him to a rage
She has a little mirror
It’s in a secret place
She used to be so pretty
Now she can’t recognise her face

(The beast is looking out from behind his eyes)

Chorus
Is the man lying low, is the beast on the rise?
Will the beast be looking out at her
Looking out
Looking out
Looking out at her
From behind his eyes?"

track_1320571,"You are a clenched fist sticking stubbornly
out of a mace head made out of snakes head;
I can't see you for the coils.

You want nothing more than to crush your enemies
I'll use you to crush mine instead;
and grow rich from all the spoils.

You're not the bad news you thought you were.

You are desperately writing me into a symphony
so you can have the final say;
while I feel your anger boil.

You are a fruit that grew too ripe for the true
that nourished it, so you punished it;
I can't eat you because you're spoiled.

I can't see you for the coils.

You are climbing a pole and it's out of your control.
You are selling your soul and it's out of your control."
track_1320631,
track_1320576,"I've got a restless heart,
and you've got itchy feet.
I always notice you,
you always notice me. 

You've got a lot of work,
and I guess I do too.
And we are both aware
of what we have to do.

Smoking on the ride home.

There's no one in front of me,
there's no one behind either.
But I'll turn all the lights out and keep on driving
I will pretend that I am nowhere.

And we are both away,
dreaming separate dreams,
but we'll meet in the middle
and sew up our seams."

track_1325602,"Just like the water
falling from the sky
at night
Just like a new star
breeding new heights

I walk the night looking up
hoping to find the peace that i'm missing
I walk the day looking down
and pray
I walk the earth feeling cold
until i see home

Just like the sun
in the grey
Just like a new life
breathing from within"

track_1326218,"Our love’s been a long time coming, building deep inside
Gonna be the love too strong to hide. Everybody’s gonna know,
they’ll look at us and smile, good love’s even better when it take a while.
I can take the old folks laughing, their knowing little smiles
I can take the talk about us, it’ll go away after a while
And I’ll be loving you, the only love I ever needed
when all is said and through. I think about you all the time
You know I do. How lucky I am
To be with you

And I hope you feel the same way twenty years from now
Glad we’ve found each other somehow.
A love like ours only come along one time if at all
The waiting on that one time really worth the fall.
I don’t care about your past, don’t care who you’ve done
Just want us to be together, two lives lived as one and I’ll be loving you.
The only love I ever needed when all is said and through
I think about you all the time, you know I do
How lucky I am
How lucky I am
How lucky I am
To be with you"
track_1326219,
track_1326221,"Dark when I go to work
Dark when I come home
Living in artificial light
Brings me so far down

Memories and reality
Find their way to destroy me
Leaving me in misery
I can’t shake

(Chorus)
When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
I get down
Down, down, down

Everyone is buying things
Going to big parties
All I want to do is sleep
And hide

But nightmares wake me up
Haunted by spiraling thoughts
Just don’t see any joy
Or peace

When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
When the sun hardly comes out
I get down
Down, down, down

Nothing that I do
Seems to change a damn thing
I’ll just keep pushing through
Until the light of spring

When the sun finally comes out
When the sun finally comes out
When the sun finally comes out
Lifts me up
Up, up, up, up, up…"

Put all your faith and trust in me

Put your hands together
Feel the love I never knew before
And if the world starts turning
Let our love keep burning ever more.

Our love forever more...

Show me the way.
