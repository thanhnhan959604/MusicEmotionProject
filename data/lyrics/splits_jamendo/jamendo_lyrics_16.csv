track_1356313,"The ones who led and lost their way.
The ones who followed went astray.
They didn’t find the light of day.
Twisted by the new religion.
Frightened by the final vision.
Compromised by distant laws that found the key and lost the door. 

Something points me in a new direction but nothing changes at all.
Nothing changes my chain of thought.
I’ve been talking to the trees. They tell me “You’ve been too lonely too long.”
Far too lonely for far too long. 
Far too lonely for far too long.
Far too lonely for too long.

Familiar faces turn to go.
I keep their names so that you’ll know the ones who loved you loved you so. 
An endless day that passed in minutes.
The scale of time that fell within it 
Swept its hands across your face 
And gouged the lines – the fall from grace.

Something points me in a new direction but nothing changes at all.
Nothing changes my chain of thought.
Voices whisper on the breeze and tell me “You’ve been too lonely too long.”
Far too lonely for far too long. 
Far too lonely for far too long.
Far too lonely for too long.

Something points me in a new direction but nothing changes at all.
Nothing changes my chain of thought.
I’ve been talking to the trees. They tell me “You’ve been too lonely too long.”
Far too lonely for far too long. 
Far too lonely for far too long.
Far too lonely for too long."
track_1356315,"Ghost writer, ghost writer, ghost writer. 

You're the silent haze. It's strange how your shadow strays 
Though you've gone to a better place. 
I pretend that I didn't see you, you know I do. 
Ghost writer, ghost writer, ghost writer. 

You're my secret fear - so beguiling and so sincere 
With your warm whisperings in my ears. 
I pretend that I didn't hear you, you know I do. 
Ghost writer, ghost writer, ghost writer. 

I don't know if I can go all the way to the other side with you. 
But in the end what is life anyway? Are we both shadows in the room? 

So erase my name with my worries and all my pain, 
But if morning should rise again I'll deny that I ever loved you, you know I will. 
Ghost writer, ghost writer, ghost writer. 

I don't know if I can go all the way to the other side with you. 
But in the end what is life and anyway we're all just shadows in the room. 

So erase my name with my memories and all my shame 
But if morning should rise again I'll deny that I ever loved you, you know I will. 
Ghost writer, ghost writer, ghost writer. 

Ghost writer, ghost writer, ghost writer."
track_1356312,"In these dim and distant eyes, in this troubled, twisted mind all directions point away,
No dimensions. Every day is an unending day.

Oh and I know you can help me to explain my pain away.
Oh and I know it’s not right to make you share my pain this way.
Oh and I know every debt must be repaid
So in every way I will love you more, more, more, more.
In every way I will love you more, more, more more. 
In every way I will love you more. 

In these rolling eyes of stone, in this reeling, restless mind all directions point away,
No dimensions. Every day is an unending day.

Oh and I know you can help me to explain my pain away.
Oh and I know it’s not right to make you share my pain this way.
Oh and I know every debt must be repaid
So in every way I will love you more, more, more, more.
In every way I will love you more, more, more more. 
In every way I will love you more."
track_1356325,"In isolation ethereal girl waits. Didn’t I tell you she was an only child? 
You’ll get inside her if you confide in me. 
And isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 

This isolation ethereal girl hates. Didn’t I tell you you were the only hope? 
You’ve got to find love before you will find yourself. 
And isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 

You’ve got to find love before you will find yourself. 
You’ve got to find love before you will find yourself. 
And isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind? 
Isn’t it high time you made up your mind?"
track_1356337,"Blind faith is on my side. It all comes right in time. 
I’ve learned to love those blues – martyrs to the truth. 
See - you see right through me. See - you look in to me. 
See – the world’s not crumbling, tumbling. 

Just lost all track of time. It slipped right out of my mind, 
Not by chance – by design. 
Maybe I will learn to try. Maybe I need you. 
My fingers fumbling. My words come stumbling. 
It all comes tumbling down. Tumbling, tumbling, tumbling 

These dreams won’t be denied. They’ll all come true some time. 
And you know those hands won’t sake. That aching heart won’t break. 
See the fingers fumbling. See the words come stumbling. 
See – the world’s not crumbling. 

Just lost all track of time. It slipped right out of my mind, 
Not by chance – by design. 
Maybe I will need to try. Maybe I need you. 

You know these dreams fall into place. Maybe I need you. 
My fingers fumbling. My words come stumbling. 
It all comes tumbling down. Tumbling, tumbling, tumbling."
track_1356344,"I’ve read the stories – love’s fairy tales - 
Ancient histories where wisdom prevails. 
Compassionate passion to touch and to smell 
But heaven forgive me, it makes my life seem hell. 

I’m going down now. Catch me on the way down. 
Be there when I come round. 
I’m going down now. Meet me when I get down. 
Don’t leave me to my own small thoughts. 

Not looking for bed love. Just wanted to say 
“It’s living without love that makes me feel this way.” 

I’m going down now. Catch me on the way down. 
Be there when I come round. 
I’m going down now. Meet me when I get down. 
Don’t leave me to my own small thoughts 

I’m king of derision so you don’t have to fake. 
‘cause I know the secret’s you just make the same mistakes. 

I’m going down now. Catch me on the way down. 
Be there when I come round. 
I’m going down now. Meet me when I get down. 
Don’t leave me to my own small thoughts."
track_1356347,"We made a vow we could never ever keep. 
Still somehow the thought of it runs deep. 
There is the glory of the coming of the glory of the Lord 
And there’s an answer where there was no call. 
But I’ve been so unkind, no heart, no mind. 
If I could give it all I would give it all 
I would give it all to you,to you, for you. 

This is it for you. This is it for you. This is it for you. This is all. 

But I will take your money - take it with a cursory smile. 
It’s only fashion sense. Don’t take offence - I don’t like the style. 
Tables turned. I call the shots. Will I be your friend? 
God knows where it started or where it will end. 


Don’t ask me now “Was honesty the crime?” 
Don’t ask me now, maybe some other time. 
What is there to say and what is there to prove 
And who is there to prove it to? 
Because there’s no sense in false pretence 
Would I ever lie to you or for you? 

This is it for you. This is it for you. This is it for you. This is all. 

But I will take your money - take it with a cursory smile. 
It’s only fashion sense. Don’t take offence - I don’t like the style. 
Tables turned. I call the shots. Will I be your friend? 
God knows where it started or where it will end. 

But I will take your money - take it with a cursory smile. 
It’s only fashion sense. Don’t take offence - I don’t like the style. 
Tables turned. I call the shots. Will I be your friend? 
God knows where it started or where it will end."
track_1356348,
track_1356349,"In motion, slow motion, here comes despair - there goes my hook line. 
It’s something for nothing. It’s in my cards and in my star sign. 

Where’s the glimmer of hope? Where’s the flicker of doubt? 
Where’s the reason to bring the change about? 
I’ve been looking for looks. I’ve been looking for charm. 
I’ve been looking for new. I’m not looking for love. 

I’m not looking for love. I’m just playing for time. 
Don’t go wasting your love. Don’t go wasting your time. 

You’re thinking. What you thinking? That thought is always on my mind. 
Believe me, believe me. I’m not man enough to make the bass line. 

Where’s the king of the croon? Where’s the prince of the rhyme?
Is he singing in tune and playing in time? 
I’m not getting the breaks, still no change in my luck. 
And I’m still on my own. I’m not looking for love. 

I’m not looking for love. I’m just playing for time. 
Don’t go wasting your love. Don’t go wasting your time. 

When the motive is fame the emotion is fear. 
I’ve been planning to ring the changes here. 
If we’re counting the cost make a mark on my slate. 
I’ve watching the form. I’ve been watching that space. 

I’m not looking for love.Oh no. I’m just playing for time. 
Don’t go wasting your sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love. Don’t go wasting your time. 

I'm not looking for love. I'm just playing for time. 
Don't go wasting your love.."

track_1356848,"Outside fall the tears of rain. Inside cries the voice of pain. 
Coal fire shadows lick my face. They expire in their rightful place. 

Coal fire, coal fire, coal fire, coal fire 

Now I’m back on the streets of this dirty old town, an invisible man with a curse and a frown. I’ve been wondering when and I’m wondering how to rekindle the flame and burn the changes. 

This house used to be a home. Now this house it’s just wood and stone. 
Upstairs, where the doors are closed, no flames penetrate that cold. 

Coal fire, coal fire, coal fire, coal fire 

I just wanted to know if you’re coming around to the happy hello or the final showdown. 
I‘ve been wondering when and I’m wondering how to rekindle the flame and burn the changes. 

Coal fire, coal fire, coal fire, coal fire 

Are you thinking of me ‘cause I’m thinking of you. 
I used to think for myself. Now I’m thinking for two. 
But we know where to be and we know what to do 
To rekindle the flame and burn the changes."
track_1356854,"You’ll be lonely by yourself, still alone with someone else. Don’t I know that? 
Where’s the one that I once knew -holding hands with someone new? Don’t you know me? 
With each new angry word I say, I know I’m driving you away. I don’t mean to. 

Who’s your flunky? What’s the score? What do you want to hurt me for? I know I’m over you now. 
Who’s the flunky on your case – another pretty tail to chase? I know I’m over you now. 
I know I’m over getting over you now. 

Line your lovers heel to toe, in single file, in tidy rows. You didn’t know them. 
And every angry word I say is driving you further and further away. I don’t mean to. 

Who’s your flunky turning on? By tomorrow he’ll be gone. I know I’m over you now. 
I know I’m over getting over you now 
But you know I’ve no idea why, or how it is you know the losing hand is mine. 

Who’s your flunky? What’s the score? What do you want to hurt me for? I know I’m over you now. 
I know I’m over getting over you now."
track_1356870,"Wipe out those tears; I’ve seen them all before. 
Small talk your fears; I’ve heard them all before. 

You think so you are. That’s why you’re sad as hell. 
I think I am as sad as hell as well. 

I love your sadness and I love you sadly. 

Blue nights, black days oh I know all about. 
I came; I’ll stay until we talk it out. 
You think so you are. That’s why you’re sad as hell. 
I think I am as sad as hell as well. 

I love your sadness and I love you sadly. 

All things must change. No lives can stay the same. 
All things must end. They come to life again. 

You think so you are. That’s why you’re sad as hell. 
I think I am as sad as hell as well."
track_1356872,"Hey bushy bushy blonde hairdo with your butterfly eyes 
I say you’re nobody’s hero with your mafia ties. 
You give me colamericana. You give me kisses from France 
And in the cattle market an Aborigine dance and I give you 

Romantic lies, longing sighs, flowers for your hair. 
There’s no getting through to this dead end dude when spring is in the air. 
Those subway nights and high rise sights skyscraper away ooh yeh 
And no stupid law, no law can take your pride away. 

Hey sleazy sleazy go easy. You’ve got your sycophant fans. 
You come on all nice and bright and breezy. You didn’t even give us a chance. 
Your daddy’s good-looking, well your mama says “He’ll do”. 
What you got cooking? I know I’m untrue but I’ll give you 

Romantic lies, longing sighs, flowers for your hair. 
There’s no getting through to this dead end dude when spring is in the air. 
No lonely night’s gonna make it right. I scrape away ooh yeh. 
And no law, no no stupid law can take your pride away."
track_1356875,"Sleep tight, healthy, wealthy, wise. Uptight, I can’t close my eyes.
A chemical haze, lights in the sky. Something’s making the rabbits cry. 
The ladder to fame, boys in their games and I don’t know why. 

Payday for the ones who dare - strange ways of the entrepreneur. 
A choke in the smoke, a sting in the eye, burning the wings of a butterfly, 
Fanning the flames, boys in their games and I don’t know why. 

Nose dive into make believe. Landslide into victory. 
Allaying the fear, trashing the doubt – the power that blew its own fuses out. 
The ladder to fame, boys in their games and I don’t know why. 

Peepshow – anyone you know? Soho – there’s the new Bardot. 
Pushing the march to make the boys sigh. An honest mistake for an alibi. Pantomime dames, boys in their games and I don’t know why."
track_1357000,"Words that liberate, free your mind of hate, words that simply state “I love you.” 
Words that crucify make you wonder why words that pacify still fail you. 
What I wouldn’t give, what I wouldn’t do for someone to talk to. 
How I needed to, how I wanted you for someone to talk to. 

I bide away my time, tired of waiting in line for someone to talk to. 

Words that mystify, seeming to imply words can multiply their meaning. 
How they propagate, how they simulate. They don’t communicate the feeling. 
Words in monotone, sinking stepping stones, mouthings of a clone I bring you. 
What you wouldn’t give, what you wouldn’t do for someone to talk to. 

You bide away your time, tired of waiting in line for someone to talk to."
track_1357005,"I'm out on my own again, though I'm not blue. 
I don't feel the lonely pain some others do. 
For those who try to shape my mind - you haven't got a clue. 
I'm through with you. 

I'm wiser and wizened now. This much is true: 
I don't get surprised much now by what you do. 
The phases pass in fashion fads disguised as something new. 
There's nothing new. 

That's me and I'm fine. Got my car, my guitar and my beer and I'm fine. 
I'll be out of line, out of tune, out of place, out of phase out of mind, 
out of my time. 

If you want to be, want to be all that you've got to be 
Climb out of the minds of men from ivory towers. 
Climb over their swords and pens - their mighty powers. 
No lies to spiel, no high ideals to hopelessly pursue. 
I'm through with you. 

That's me, and I'm sound, Got my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground. 
I'll be out of line, out of tune, out of place, out of phase out of mind, 
out of my time. 
Oh you’ve got to be, got to be all that you want to be."
track_1357009,"When I left my job I was sad to go for another job. 
It only goes to show no ambition. 
Before I found my feet, I'd hit the floor. 
I hit the street. I hit the bottle more - like a loser. 

But Caroline, for all we know, the winds of change will start to blow. 
Maybe they're starting to blow. 

So I went along. I went prepared for better times, 
Believing every word - each iota. 
If we sell our car and sold until we sold ourselves 
We'd still not pay the bills in our lifetime. 

Caroline, we wasted days in dark despair and drunken haze - 
Only to mend our ways. 

You said so many things that made me want to shout. 
Like I don't know what it's all about to be down. 
As if only. 

But Caroline, for all we know, the winds of change will start to blow. 
Listen, they're starting to blow."
track_1357012,"Read the play about wisdom, time and age - and for me new words on every page. 
Don’t they say that all the world’s a stage? I’m in my role again. I’m just a stand in. 
Hello tedium my old friend. We’ve been together since I don’t know when. 
Brought me nothing but bad luck, babe. I want something. I wanna free the world. 

Who decides the gender, creed and race? Who decides who gets the pretty face? 
Here she comes – the golden girl in case. Here am I again – her blue eyed boy. 
I’ve got something to say in my defence cos that’s my forte – past time, past tense. 
You brought me nothing but bad luck, babe. 
You say “No”. I say “So let’s go free the world.” 

Hello tedium, my old friend. We’ll be together, be together ‘til the end. 
You brought me nothing but bad luck. 
You know that I want, I want, I wanna free the world."
track_1357014,"Yesterday, with the weight of the world off my mind, 
I left the human race to its heart-aching grind. 
That's no shame, and if solitaire is our game, 
we're committing no crime. We're only wasting our own time. 

And we are like falling stars - sky high to the ground. 
Let there be hallelujahs sung, like no other sound from this world. 

With today came a heavy dose of the blues, 
lurking like tomorrow in yesterday's news. 
History may make no mention of us. 
With summertime in our eyes, we'll fade away on the sunrise. 

And we are like falling stars - sky high to the ground. 
Let there be hallelujahs sung, like no other sound from this world."
track_1357016,"I was happy on the day I met you. 
Then I jumped through the hoops that I'm still jumping through. 
You're written in the lines on my face. 
Don't the lines on my hands testify my fate? 

I was friendly in a roundabout way, 
Wasn't wise to your lies or the games you could play. 
I'm sorry that I came unprepared, but then 
Sorry, of course, is a death defying word 

The sticks and the stones have shattered my bones. 
Names have merely disembowelled me. 
But I won't be a slave from the crib to the grave. 
I'm on my knees the Lord to praise. 
In heart, in mind and in soul I'm bluer than you. 

It's not easy when you've fallen from grace, 
When your heart is exposed and explodes in your face. 
And every time I open my eyes 
I see wise men and fools portending my demise. 

I was happy til the day I met you, 
Had a song in my heart and an aim to be true. 
Now I've got a thought to appease. 
There's no rest for my mind, no cure for my disease. 

It's the sticks and the stones that shatter your bones. 
Names can only disembowel you. 
But I won't be a slave from the crib to the grave. 
I'm on my knees the Lord to praise. 
In heart, in mind and in soul I'm bluer than you."
track_1357019,"You know I wouldn’t hurt you, leave you lonely, out in the cold. 
I love you all the time in wintertime. 

You lead me to destruction. Without conscience you’d sell my soul 
But I love you all the time in wintertime. 

Take me. Don’t spare this martyr. He won’t desert you. He’ll fight your wars. 
He loves you all the time in wintertime. 

Mumble famous last words: All’s forgiven - It’s too absurd. 
I love you all the time in wintertime."
track_1357021,"Here's to you who I know so well and you who don't even know my name. 
I'll keep these memories with me always, in case I don't see you again. 
This looks like the beginning of the ending, though I don't want to have to say &quot;Goodbye&quot; 
because every time that we all come together, you get me feeling 15 storeys high. 

And here's to you who have made me smile and you who've become eternal friends, 
And all you who make this life worthwhile, in case I don't see you again. 
I won't complain or claim I'm feeling lonely. Loneliness is just a state of mind. 
Because since the last time we all came together, I've been feeling 15 storeys high. 

I drink much more than I used to do and start on the road to way back when. 
‘cause it keeps these four walls from closing in, in case I don’t see you again."
track_1357022,"Well, some die hoping, but you still thought you'd get 
A fair day's pay for all your trouble and sweat. 
And in a slow-mo replay, placebo your years away, 
Maybe live them all out like in some morality play. 

But you know how it is, 'cause it happens all the time. 
Life was never very kind. Look, don't you waste my time. 

There is a small possibility that good things can be found 
With your head in the clouds and your two flat feet on the ground. 
You were a sad eyed suicide sobbing like Johnnie Ray. 
Like the means to the end could be justified that way. 

But you know how it is, 'cause it happens all the time. 
Life was never kind. Look, don’t you waste my time."
track_1357024,"Let me throw away all my inhibitions and tell you things as they are. 
I would sell your soul to get half a chance to be a rock n roll star. 
I know it's only a song and there's no one listening and I should let it all be. 
But nobody knows what it is they're missing and that's what's getting to me. 

This life is insane. It's so precious but then it's as pointless as you and as me. 
And I don't understand. I'm just one grain of sand. 
I can't be what you want me to be. 

Well I should say what I think but I'm always bluffing and that's the price of the fame. 
It should mean everything but it all means nothing. I'm not controlling this game. 
And you're looking at me but I can't look at you. 
I'm a slave in your land of the free. 
And I don't understand. I'm just one grain of sand. 
I can't be what you want me to be. 

I slip outside my mind and all life's confines, 
be divine and bore you with my euphoria. No, no I won't lie. 

Well I do appreciate all your kindness for this bald Liverpool freak. 
I've been right round the world. You know, all I find is the earth inherits the meek. 
If you aim for the stars, you'll have further to fall when you hit the glass ceiling. You'll see! 
And I don't understand. I'm just one grain of sand 
I can’t be what you want me to be."
track_1357025,"I should have, should have, should have forever been indebted 
But I do know, I know, I know all things remain the same. 
Summer came. It wouldn’t stay. It couldn’t melt my blues away. 
It didn’t change a thing. It didn’t change a thing. 
And people grow. Oh my! How we’ve grown. 

We love like yesterday, a relocation hideaway where we can be alone. 
I flood your eyes in laser light and video film your head tonight. Television’s home. 

I could have, could have, could have smashed your place to pieces 
But I reasoned, reasoned, reasoned in many shades of grey. 
Ah you’re looking cool. You’re not so hot. You’ll never melt my blues that way. 
It didn’t mean a thing. It didn’t mean a thing. 
And people change. My! How we’ve changed. 

It’s over rated - the understatement of far too many cold years. 
It’s such a complicated situation; couldn’t wait to see you again."
track_1357027,"Well me I don’t know where the years go, stooping so low away. 
I waited so long for my swan song; such a sweet song to play. 

No one’s telling me how I ought to be. I am alright. Yes, I’m alright. 

I take a skydive, on the down slide. That’s the dark side of grey. 
But it’s a sure thing feels like falling. Me I’m falling away. 

No one’s telling me what I should have been. I was alright. I was alright."
track_1357105,"Worlds above me rain down on me pennies for my eyes 
Angel voices ever singing echo through the sky. 
They're holier than thou, but I'm just spacedust now, following my calling. 
I fell asleep; I kept on falling - that's the way life goes 
And what you give is all you're given, as you reap you sew. 
I'm holier than thou, but I'm just spacedust now, following my calling. 
There's no beginning and no ending. Always was and always is.
Never ending new beginnings - nothing more to life than this. 
Worlds around me, worlds inside me, worlds I'll never know. 
The love you gave - it almost saved me from the world below. 
I'm holier than thou, but I'm just spacedust now, following my calling 
There's no beginning and no ending. Always was and always is.
Never ending new beginnings - nothing more to life than this. 
We're holier than thou and we're all spacedust now, following our calling 
We kiss this world goodbye. Kiss this world goodbye. 
We kiss this world goodbye. Oh, my, my, my"
track_1357118,"Let’s take a walk in the sunshine and let the world know it’s still mine. 
It’s been ignoring me for so long. 
The positivity tastes nice; improbability feels right. 
The sleazy city’s a long way gone. 
No one can take what is already mine. I’ve earned my place in the sunshine. 
God only knows I have trawled back through time 
In memory of all those I have loved. 
The rainy season was in me; a howling wind on a cruel sea. 
You fight your enemies on your own. 
Though time and tide have come to me and all of life has passed through me, 
I face infinity still unknown. 
No one can take what is already mine. I’ve earned my place in the sunshine. 
God only knows I have trawled back through time 
In memory of all those I have loved. 
Let’s take a walk in the sunshine."
track_1357120,"There’s a lifeline that follows me right down the centuries 
And burns like a quasar within me. If you could see into my soul, 
There’s a darkness that shines through the dust on my halo. 
I’m trying to learn how to say &quot;no&quot;. Oh, you can see into my soul. 
But oh my God! Lord of all mercy, why would you desert me? 
There’s no reason for learning to think in a straight line. 
The pleasure and pain would be still mine if I could see into your soul, 
Where the truth goes finally fading away now, 
The light of the moon by the day now - If I could see into your soul. 
But oh my God! Lord of all mercy, why would you curse me? 
There’s dust on my halo. There’s dust on my halo."
track_1357121,"Newspaper made your success. Your face is a peach and your life it’s a mess. 
That’s the story - &quot;rags to glory&quot;. And people believe what they say - 
You signed on a line then you learned how to play. It was easy. 
And people believe anything. You’re top of the pops and you can’t even sing. 
It’s so easy. It can’t be that easy. Oh man! It’s too easy. 
Brought to your knees by tabloid sleaze - they’re laughing at you. 
And quelle surprise! Their stinking lies were true. 
You’ll find no place in the real world for a dreamer. 
There’s no safe place in the real world for a dreamer."
track_1357125,"Some say it’s no good, life’s no good. I Say that they’ve misunderstood. 
Then I fall on my face again. I’m back at the start again. 
Like the hope that never was, life’s a pipedream and I always knew it was. 
And I know every long lost lonesome road on the way to the end of the world. 
Some pray in these dark days of sin. And you say “The sun shines from within”. 
Then you fall on your face again. You’re back at the start again. 
In the circle of your friends there’s a comradeship whose journey never ends. 
And I know every savage sea you sailed on the way to the end of the world. 
Like the hope that never was, life’s a pipedream and I always knew it was. 
And I know how your loneliness evolved on the way to the end of the world."
track_1357128,"I sang my songs like all the other fakes; 
Ashamed to make the same old tired mistakes. 
If I let you down it won’t be the last time. 
I’m a fawning clown for your love. 
There’s a whole wild world lying in between us. 
I don’t think we’ve ever been so far apart. 
All you Saints and seers and all you non-believers, 
We don’t want to get back to Monday. 
I blew my mind in many shades of grey; 
Laid to rest in love with yesterday 
Where my headstone reads &quot;Didn’t make much difference - 
All my thoughts and deeds and all my love&quot;. 
And no-one sang a song to change my world. 
And no-one saw the colours that I heard. 
I should fake control, learn to show some feeling, 
Fenestrate my soul for my love. 
There’s a whole wild world lying in between us. 
I don’t think we’ve ever been so far apart. 
All you Saints and seers and all you non-believers, 
We don’t want to get back to Monday."
track_1357123,"Today the cool winds of dawn fazed me out; I couldn’t beat the countdown. 
At last, without grace, I’ve learned how to lose. 
I’m on the tack that brings me back to you. 
I don’t know, but I’m told that the truth is stranger than fiction - 
An ominous, anonymous message we all miss. 
Can a Jesus freak speak with no obvious conviction? 
I’ll take it from you I’m part of this. 

Did you ever dream of peace in our time? You couldn’t keep your people in line. 
Maybe we should try and spend a little more time together, together, together. 

Somewhere someone crash-dived their life making peace like there was no tomorrow. 
I know ‘cause I saw the last days of earth as it creaked and sighed, sank and died alone. 
There’s a letter in the sand and it’s signed, sealed and scented - 
An asinine line someone forgot to send 
To the only true blue that the human race invented. 
&quot;Here’s all of our hearts world without end.&quot; 

Did you ever dream of peace in our time? You couldn’t keep your people in line. 
Maybe we should try and spend a little more time together, together, together."
track_1357130,"What you see won't be what you get, you bet your last. 
And someone will be singing &quot;Life's a Gas&quot;. 
I'll get off my back, get on my bicycle and ask. 
I want you. I want you. I want you. 
All day long I wonder what the hell went wrong with me. 
And I must confess I don't profess to be 
An expert spouting complex philosophies. 
Just want you. I want you. I want you. 
I can see it's much too much to ask for. 
I can see you don't believe a word. 
But I feel I've learned my lesson. 
I want you. I want you. I want you. 
It occurs to me that all my dreams are dreams of yesterday. 
All is shallow, blasé or passé. 
All indications seem to point the same way. 
I want you. I want you. I want you. 
I want you. I want you. I want you."
track_1357129,"Heaven won’t hold me so I’ll need heaven no more. 
Heaven won’t hold me. I won’t need heaven any more. 
The greatest story ever told won’t break my heart or prepossess my soul. 
Money won’t hold me. I’ll be imprisoned no more. 
Possessions won’t tie me down the way they do - won’t be imprisoned any more. 
The checkout line keeps moving on and this despair may last ‘til kingdom come. 
Folks we’re always on our own, stumbling up our endless, winding roads. 
Some folks act as if they know where they are and where they’re gonna go. 
Let us pray for a working class hero. What a sham and a lie and a joke. 
Anybody can see that nobody is free, and that’s all. 
Some are as equal as others. Others more equal than most. 
But everyone goes to their place I suppose. And that’s all, that’s all, that’s all. 
Heaven won’t hold me. I won’t need heaven any more."
track_1357131,"I came and I saw love, but I waited; I looked to another night. 
There is a song - a black refrain that’s racked with guilt and teased by pain. What does it mean? 
It lifts for no reason, changes moods like the seasons. As if I had to prove myself. 
But I could only sing to you, pray for you, read our last rites. 
I know that song; it’s Casablancan night. 
Foresight, like twilight it flees. Moonlighting and caution floats on the breeze across the sea. 
There is a song keeps haunting me - my malady for all to see. What does it mean? 
See love in its death row. Come and laugh at the sideshow. I didn’t have to prove myself. 
I only had to sing to you, pray for you, read our last rites. 
I know that song; it’s Casablancan night."

Look how the buildings rise, scratching the sky and the people go crazy. 
People go crazy but sure as the crow flies I will still be your baby. 
I’m thinking things that are better unsaid. Though I get uptight, 
I’d be the first to say &quot;Everything’s fine. It’s OK&quot; but it’s crazy. 
World has gone crazy, but sure as the crow flies I will still be your baby. 
Pure as the sunshine I will be your sweet baby. 
All over the land we’re like breathing the culture like gasoline. 
The throwaway lives we lead make it so hard to believe anything. 
I’m thinking you are disturbingly kind, though I don’t know why. 
Your past is black as hell, dark as the night. 
You were never a lady when you were my lady, 
But sure as the crow flies I will still be your baby. 
Pure as the sunshine I will be your sweet baby. 
Sure as the crow flies I will still be your baby."

Mum was a vet in Australia, born of a painter from France  
Grandma grew up in Colombia and only understood grandpa once

My first true love was Italian, she used to drink from a cup
She was a whiz with a saucepan and taught me to mix it all up

Mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, got to mix it up
Polka, Gipsy and Mambo
Chili peppers in wine

Mix it up, mix it up, mix it up, got to mix it up
Reggae, Bluegrass, and Tango

My wife was born in a circus, her dad juggled jellyfish 
Her brother Joe had a sex change and now he’s called Sister Trish

Uncle Muhammed was German, he played guitar in Tibet 
Cousin Sarah went bonkers and now she strips on the Net

My second love was Brazilian, she used to drink from a mug
She was a whiz with the shaker and taught me to mix it all up

Quem não gosta de mistura e acredita em coisa pura
saiba que um dia água e óleo vão se misturar
É só ver a natureza, a diferença é a beleza
Peixes de um milhão de cores nadando no mesmo mar
E quem não quiser olhar vai sofrer até cansar
Idéia nova em cuca dura bate, bate até entrar
Se não quiser desistir, vai bater até cair
porque rapadura é doce, mas é dura de quebrar

And all I got was an aching back
A ghost in drag came in my room
She said “close your eyes to see the bloom”

Lightning bolts from underground
I lost the end, I was out of bounds
Extra spicy dynamite
A crispy taste in every bite

Come set me on fire
Just set me on fire
Walls, may they burn on down
Let’s walk on the wire
Step on to the wire
Just dancing above the ground

All my life I’ve been so numb
Endless thoughts like rolling drums
I slammed the door, I shut’em down
I sent’em back to tinsel town

Spinning wheels along the line
Firecrackers up my spine
Extra spicy pepper sauce
Navigation; changing course

Come set me on fire
Just set me on fire
Walls, may they burn on down
Let’s walk on the wire
Step on to the wire
Just dancing above the ground

You can stop pretending
You may start surrendering
If you’re here it’s not far
To become what you are

Come set me on fire
Just set me on fire
Walls, may they burn on down
Let’s walk on the wire
Step on to the wire
Just dancing above the ground"

Everybody's telling me
Love is not it seems to be
Hurts though you don't want it be

But it better walk my way
let the harming voices fade
Living the way I do

Here I am outside your door
Trying to collect my thoughts
Silly words from yesterday

I feel like I loose my mind
Everytime when you're around
I have so much to say

Everything will change one day
Every moment is gonna fade
Blurring all the memories

Telling me nobody can love forever back today
I'll overcome my fears

Gonna take our chance
And now read the answers in your eyes
No - it's gonna be alright

We're just so much alike
All the wrongs becoming right
You make me feel alive

Our deepest desires will now face the sun
Buried in tears through the years they were 
Burning in our souls

The silence was winning for far too long
But no more will fear come to claim its toll
The time for redemption has come and the 
Battle has begun

I dont't need no empty promises
I want you there beside me

Help me to find myself
Save me before it's over
Ride through the deepest night
Fight till the dawn's first light
The time is now, 
Cover my soul with your grace

For each day of pain we would celebrate
For those were the lessons that life portrait
Giving us wisdom and skills and now
All come down to this

The power bestowed to us by the gods
Has long been forgotten in wells of dust
And every remembrance of faith almost
Withered in the air

I dont't need no empty promises
I want you there beside me

Been chasing my tail reaching the end of the trail
But once again betrayed

all of my darkest fears
No more will they hold me back no more will they drag me down
I'm shedding no more tears

And I know there is something more
More than I see in these lifeless eyes
And I feel there's another life
Buried away in my fearless cries

I need to see the rays of hope, breaking the walls of my dark blindfold
I need to feel the raging fires melting the chains like in days of old

I'm turning the screw and face my troubles anew
I'll take it day by day
Confronting myself  until the time of my death
With no more dues to pay
The system has failed but in its gears I derailed
For long I walked astray
It now seems so clear what once was hidden in fear
So that I find my way

And I know there is something more

It keeps getting harder bearing the cross to be

On and on life always passes by
Never know what  tommorow will bravely bring
No control no need to even try
Just live the now for it goes by in a blink

Making plans is a joke in the face of gods
Control is just an illusion my friend
Misery  comes before you can come to grabbs
With the fact that your path's coming to an end

Its time to leave all the burdens behind
And let the blowing winds take me

The parting of old ways
The final chapter
They really sometimes feel
Like a little taste of death

Dive into the unknown, head first into the blackest hole
There must be gold through the other side
A land of wonders awaits my ride
If I could let go of all control

Noone should condemn you for being you and not being them

Heading out in the snow, through the haze i will go
Don't need your firy prison to save me

Sometimes there's no wright or wrong

All good in this life besides death,  that seems so far
Nothing but hatred feels sacred all the dreams I have painted
all the colors have faded, except blue and black

The weight has awaken me, as I carry the world on my shoulders

And the signs unfolding before me now and I know
I have to break the chains of my past
And the sky above me is free of clouds and I wait
before I fly away to the sun

This is the time of rebellion, long overdue
Fear was my only companion, this just wont  do
Burning inside are the voices that desided the choices
I have made through the ages, both lies and truths

All now has forsaken me, while I cry for fallen soldiers
The weight has awaken me, as I carry the world on my shoulders

And the signs unfolding before me now and I know
I have to break the chains of my past
And the sky above me is free of clouds and I wait

Go diving in a sea during storm

There in the fog his form appeared
Screaming my name I heard him saying clear

Give me your life, give me your soul

Crossing the river reached the end of the line
Through limbo lies the path that's all but benign
Have to pass every circle, and break every sin

Never before have I faced such a foe

in hardest moment weed help me to belive in it
and I breath /and i beat / like my first time
and i see / and i feel / and i look at sky
and when the wind blows the rain drawn on my windows
drops from heaven on this limbo I wait for rainbow
it's so slow today but i ride anyway
lookin for my way look the sky again
and I start to pray for a better day
rain can hide da tears but can't wash da pain away"
track_1365778,"what's is love.. what is love what is love... listen up
love is like a fire it can warms you or burns you up 
Love... breaks empires when it's tough 
Sometimes sometimes .. love ain't enough
Many times love ain't love it's just something else
they keep on call it love cuz they don't understand
Love ain't the way, love is the end
but people wanna teach me while I'm here watching' over'em
They say they love rain but when it rains they stay at home
They say they love the wind but when it blows they close the door
so I don't say I love you cuz i know the Shakespeare's words 
So I don't say i love you cuz i know how people love
I can be alone cuz i know what i want
i don't need a wife , i don't need a girl 
I know People love what they find i wanna find what I love
that's why I gotta a vibe inside of me and I wont' let it go 

Cos'è l'amore ? Cos'è l'amore ? Ascolta...L'amore è come un fuoco può riscaldarti o bruciartil'amore ...spacca gli imperi quando è &quot;tosto&quot;qualche volta..qualche volta l'amore non è abbastanza.Molte volte l'amore non è amore ma è solo qualcos'altroLoro continuano a chiamarlo amore perché non capiscono.L'amore non è la strada (per arrivare a qualcosa).. l'amore è il fine.ma la gente vuole insegnarmi mentre io sono qua e li osservo.Loro dicono di amare la pioggia ma quando piove se ne stanno a casaloro dicono di amare il vento ma quando soffia chiudono la portaquindi non ti dico ti amo perché conosco le parole di shakespear
quindi non ti dico ti amo perché so come la gente amaposso stare da solo perché so quello che voglionon ho bisogno di una moglie non ho bisogno di una ragazzaio so che la gente ama quello che trova io voglio trovare quello che amoper quello ho un brivido dentro di me e non voglio lasciarlo andare

[Verse 2]

love is forever love is forever
that's why when you say &quot;too late&quot; it's doesn't matter
that's why i keep on runnin to you , I- I can't forget
I got the sound of your name that hit me in the diagraphm 
I could be a better man gimme another chance
I could be a better man ,hope you will understand
but u don't lissen to me ,you seems to be too far from me now
so i write you a song , i try with the speed of sound
oh oh oh but love is trivial...lyrically 
so i let my fingers slide on piano easily
I mix black and white tryin' to make our melody
hope you feel my music so you can see inside of me
but you run to fast and you never stop
and you make me crush but i don't give up
so i keep on tryinin and i keep on running 
but you run so fast and sometimes i feel tired.


L'amore è per sempre l'amore è per sempreper questo quando dici &quot;troppo tardi&quot; non importaper questo continuo a correre da te , non posso dimenticareho il suono del tuo nome che mi colpisce nel diaframma potrei essere un uomo migliore dammi un'altra chancepotrei essere un uomo migliore , spero che tu capiraima non mi ascolti sembri troppo lontana da me oraquindi ti scrivo una canzone, provo con la velocità' del suono.Oh ma l'amore è banale a parolequindi faccio scivolare le dita sul mio piano facilmente..spero che tu senta la mia musica così puoi vedere dentro di mema tu corri così veloce e non ti fermi maie mi fai abbattere ma non mi arrendoquindi continuo a provare continuo a correrema corri così veloce e qualche volta mi sento stanco

[Bridge Yves]

but i really hope you understand girl
that i'm only , only , just a man
... i'll get tired to run one day
that's when you'll call my name
but i don't know if I'll be there
we'll switch position baby girl
and you'll be runnin' after me"
track_1365783,"[LYRICS]
So so so so
you back to the other man
back to the other plan
back and you leave me alone and I know i can fly....over my limits
but you made me fall in love now i'm just a man not a spirit 
I did everything for you and it didn't work 
but experience it's what you get when u don't get what you want so 
now i know love sucks but you know...whatever..
now it's enough to find somegirl 

[Verse 1]
I can make you cry I can make you laugh
I can fight for you i can make you scream in the bed
so are you really sure i can't be your man
are you really sure i can't be your man?
I could never lie , maybe it's still my fault
but i've tried so hard and I gave you my alll
i couldn't stay in that our hidden love
I kept on tryina sing it while you set the tone
You didn't want to take that risk
You closed your life won't let me in
Don't wanna you partime. you wanna say goodbye
well, it won't be so special but it's gonna be allright cuz

[Chorus]
I don't know what is wrong but it's typical
U just turn and leve me on my own
I was falling in love now i just fallin even so

my fall is always soft
my fall is always soft

I feel lost , all alone and ridicolous
but i know those pretty sexy girls 
and they know how to spoon and console so

my fall is always soft
my fall is always soft

[Verse 2]
I always been attracted to bodies and shapes
I fell in love with your smile with your brain
&quot;you and me &quot;, i'm not tryin to replace
buit I need to chill I just wanna ease the pain 
gimme another date another face another taste ..
i'm just tryin' to turn the page
you say you're happy now, so i'm happy too
but when you say that you seems to be confuse
cuz i know your eyes when you lookin at me
and i know for sho' you will miss my lips
but you won't to stay by me you wanna my surreder
so i back to my life i back to my Agenda"
track_1365784,"INTRO

My mama used to tell me
shiva now can you see 
the lights in the sky...
the most preocious gift...
and i feel so free...
and i see so free...
and  i feel so free...

VERSE 3

Ferma
guarda le cose da un'altra angolazione
costringile ad essere quello che vuoi tu
non limitarti alle mura che hai intorno
Non limitarti allo schermo della Tv
Nelle parole trovi tutto,basta fantasia una C se la ruoti diventa una barca
remo con le note in un mare di onde disegnate da S sdraiate
Essi , è un navigare diverso da quello che fai con il pc
non è il mare quello che vuoi tu?, ok baby posso darti di piu
così sia,
capovolgo e muto i www in monti curvo le braccia di una V
la trasformo in un gabbiano e ti faccio volare via"

you back (to) mine

[Verse 1]

I'd like to sing an R&amp;B ..sweet as you like
but my voice is underground my voice can't fly high
i'd makin somethin' romantic but you know i'm not that kind
and i always prefer facts instead of many apologizes
makin' love makin' war
makin war makin love
then our &quot;back'n forth&quot; has stopped to work
now we don't talk anymore but baby you shoud be happy
cuz you know a real love never ends in a good friendship
your dad wanted to kill me 'cuz of something i said
but i think he'd kill you too if he knew what you did me in our first date 
first time first impression
somethin got wrong cuz we're both young and pretencious
so we separated our destiny
you dive in another story
I'm ballin' in da vip
mo' money mo' honey
mo' bottles mo mo models
no love no battles
but with you was better

[Verse 2]

Verse two here i am still thinkin about you
Many day has passed.. still rappin' about you
I rewatch our video we took my Samsung
the way we rock da bed was somethin' hu...
love is in da air on the ground it's my rage but
as tupac I swear I'll never call you bitch again I 
dedicate my lyrics complicate what's easy
but now look into my eyes and tell me how you feelin?
you're still my Ji-Ji Jigglypuff sing-sing my lullaby
let me sleep by-by by your side back ma' make me smile

I'm your faithful dog, i'm your workhorse
My cloudless dreams came to the end
I am so jealous just can't pretend
My road was so lonesome till i met you
But you just can't imagine the pain I got through
The wall of the affection was broken by someone
Who made my whole existence so boring and humdrum

Chorus:
You caught me in you trap
A carefully woven web
I'm giving up i'm giving in
My tide began to ebb
Your soul mate seem so fine
I see you are not mine
I will clean the space between
To let you draw the line

My dreams were destroyed, changes made a mess
It doesn't mean at all that i could love you less
Once seen you together, I fell ill at ease
throughout the body stormy weather, black disease
Remember changing glances when i first met you
This time was no single thought of our last adieu
Nowhere it all goes, future is unknown
You will be queen of my life, sitting on your throne"
track_1366345,"In our city of the broken hearts
There's so many places, so many boulevards
To cry your heart out

Little girl with simple dreams
She just understood - love's not what it seems
Not what trey're talkin' about

Pre-chorus:
When the dreams come to the end
You are cryin' lonesome songs, just can't pretend
Like everything's right in your soul full of light..

Chorus:
Take me home
I'm so alone
Last train is gone
I've lost my phone
Please, driver, take me home! (x2)

The boy invited you to date
He didn't come or came too late
Wanna rearrange your life.
Sad stories are always true,
But not all truth is sad so that
You'll be alright when you'll find somebody who is right"

You- you and I.

Here and there and everywhere
Hand in hand we’re quite the pair
No place compares without you there.

Turtle doves and penguin loves
Prairie voles and seahorses

el presente es un espejo,
los cristales me devuelven
apenas de mí un reflejo.

El rostro desgastado del pasado,
aquel amor perdido,
se inclina la balanza, extraña nostalgia
por lo que aún no ha sucedido.

Las palabras me envilecen,
la gimnasia me hace daño,
ya nada es lo que parece,
terror al calendario.

Cada vez que tú me ves preguntas cómo estás,
y yo siempre digo que estoy bien,
pero esta vez prefiero ser sincero, la verdad,
hoy siento que me encuentro medio mal...
me encuentro medio mal...

Vivo dentro de una niebla
nubes sobre mí se ciernen, 
doy más vueltas que una noria,
me da igual que sea viernes

El cosmos, lo infinito, gritos, ruido de vecinos,
tostadas con espasmos, 
aquel orgasmo que se apartó de su camino.

El poder del subsconciente,
la teoría de las cuerdas
caminando de repente,
he pisado una mierda.

Cada vez que tú me ves preguntas cómo estás,
y yo siempre digo que estoy bien,
pero esta vez prefiero ser sincero, la verdad,
hoy siento que me encuentro medio mal...
me encuentro medio mal..."
track_1379396,"Yo andaba por aquel entonces más allá de los treinta,
acomodado en el pasado de mi propia experiencia.
No profesaba religión, partido ni catecismo 
y desdeñaba toda forma de romanticismo.

Saciaba mi sed de contacto con el género opuesto en acto sin previo aviso,
vamos a tú piso pero ya sabes que no busco compromiso.

Te digo adiós de lejos, tengo prisa, tú me avisas, yo te llamo si eso,
no tengo tiempo de darte ni si quiera un beso,
ya nos veremos como siempre en los espejos.

Y así vivía yo sin lazos todas mis aventuras y 
de paso mantenía intacta mi estructura.
Pero de pronto apareciste en una noche cualquiera y sin saberlo 
tú me diste una nueva primavera.

Lo que empezó siendo una chispa creció como el fuego 
y en la arista de una llama, ahora me quemo mi amor,
en una hoguera llena de ternura.

En esa noche oscura te ofrecí mi corazón a la luz de la luna,
traicioné toda razón, como hiciera Judas pagué mi redención
a cambio de locura.

Y es que en tú compañía que lentas pasan las horas
y que cortos los días, del crepúsculo a la aurora,
quién lo diría mi amor, la realidad es pura fantasía."

track_1385554,"It comes sometimes when you're down 
when you're looking mad 
when you frown 
when you're out of reach 
and expect me to call 
while I'm out bein' freak 
and you know it at all, 
but still pretend you don't 

all the times 
I'm in search of the light 
there, there goes my pride 
suffocated in the night 

It comes sometimes when you're down 
when you're looking mad 
when you frown 
when you're out of town 
and expect me to call 
while I'm out bein' a freak 
and you know it at all, 
you still pretend and say 
&quot;hey I didn't have a clue&quot; 
&quot;you didn't call my name&quot; 
&quot;I didn't think it was you&quot; 
if tomorrow it's okay out of the blue 
I'll drain my sorrows 
and spend the day to make up to you 
at least until next time 

all the times 
I'm in search of the light 
there, there goes my pride 
suffocated in the night 

well I'v been tied for so long 
long enough to make it right 
if it's still wrong 
and I know it isn't fair to remind you 
it sounds so harsh, well 

tender's the night 
when I search for the light 
there, there goes my pride 
suffocated in the night 
all the times 
I'm in search of the light 
there, there goes my pride 
suffocated in the night"
track_1385555,"well, I got no words to sing right now 
but it has just come back to me 
a memory I want to be singing about 
and it's before my eyelids 

the scent and the color of her hair 
slowly beginning to fade 
in a million tunes 

the scent and the color of her hair 
slowly my memory fades 

but I don't want anyone to see it right now 
it's a dream they can't steal 
the one that i want to be dreaming about 
it's well protected in my sleep 

the scent and the color of her hair 
slowly beginning to fade 
in a milion tunes 

the scent and the color of her hair 
slowly my memory fades"
track_1385577,"and if you can't fight for it now 
don't you know you've gotta to try? 
and if you can't fight for it now 
don't you know you've gotta to try? 
the world is at war with you now 
don't you know you've got to fight? 
and if you can't fight for it now 
don't you know you've gotta to try? (harden than I) 

when everything fades to a broken dream... 
still happy that you tried? 

nobody knows anything about you 
about you 
anyone longs for fame but you 
really do 
friends and time you have spent while pursuing this 
won't return 
nobody knows anything 
about you 

when everything fades to a broken dream... 
still happy that you 
tried?"
track_1385748,"just like anyone, I know 
I can't go on 
ignoring almost anything 

likewise anyone I know 
I'm keeping on 
filling up with these empty things 

everyone of them pretends 
are they scared about anything? 

is there anyone I know 
that like me 
stays up brooding all night long these days 

over the things we said 
things we're taking back 
things we said 
things we're taking back 
good and bad 
things we're taking back 
good and bad 
things we're taking back 

just like anyone, I know 
I might be wrong 
ignoring almost anything 

likewise anyone I know 
I'm keeping on 
filling up with these empty things 

everyone of them pretends 
are they scared about anything?

When the light goes out and the silence creeps, don't make a sound it's just you and me.
Chorus: But the sun will rise, as hard as it seems, and I'll see you again babe, if only in my dreams, if only in my dreams, if only in my dreams, I'll see you again babe, if only in my dreams.
There's never tomorrow and not enough today, we'll meet again babe no matter what it takes, when the thunder rolls, rumbling low and deep, that's where we are babe, just you and me.
Chorus: But the sun will rise, as hard as it seems, and I'll see you again babe, if only in my dreams, if only in my dreams, if only in my dreams, I'll see you again babe, if only in my dreams.
Clouds cover the moon and it's hard to see, I'm thinking of you are you remembering me, when the darkness falls, like a midnight vale  the only sound is a lonely wail.
Chorus: But the sun will rise, as hard as it seems, and I'll see you again babe, if only in my dreams, if only in my dreams, if only in my dreams, I'll see you again babe, if only in my dreams."
